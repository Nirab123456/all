       "' Chikungunya is an infection caused by the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV).[5][3] Symptoms include fever and joint pains.[2] These typically occur two to twelve days after exposure.[3] Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, and a rash.[2] Symptoms usually improve within a week; however, occasionally the joint pain may last for months or years.[2][6] The risk of death is around 1 in 1,000.[4] The very young, old, and those with other health problems are at risk of more severe disease.[2] The virus is spread between people by two types of mosquitos: Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti.[3] They mainly bite during the day.[7] The virus may circulate within a number of animals including birds and rodents.[3] Diagnosis is by either testing the blood for the virus\\'s RNA or antibodies to the virus.[3] The symptoms can be mistaken for those of dengue fever and Zika fever.[3] It is believed most people become immune after a single infection.[2] The best means of prevention is overall mosquito control and the avoidance of bites in areas where the disease is common.[4] This may be partly achieved by decreasing mosquito access to water and with the use of insect repellent and mosquito nets.[3] There is no vaccine and no specific treatment as of 2016.[3] Recommendations include rest, fluids, and medications to help with fever and joint pain.[2][3] While the disease typically occurs in Africa and Asia, outbreaks have been reported in Europe and the Americas since the 2000s.[3] In 2014 more than a million suspected cases occurred.[3] In 2014 it was occurring in Florida in the continental United States but as of 2016 there were no further locally acquired cases.[8][9] The disease was first identified in 1952 in Tanzania.[3] The term is from the Kimakonde language and means \"to become contorted\".[3] Around 85% of people infected with Chikungunya virus experience symptoms, typically beginning with a sudden high fever above 39\\xa0°C (102\\xa0°F).[10] The fever is soon followed by severe muscle and joint pain.[11] Pain usually affects multiple joints in the arms and legs, and is symmetric – i.e. if one elbow is affected, the other is as well.[11] People with Chikungunya also frequently experience headache, back pain, nausea, and fatigue.[11] Around half of those affected develop a rash, with reddening and sometimes small bumps on the palms, foot soles, torso, and face.[11] For some, the rash remains constrained to a small part of the body; for others, the rash can be extensive, covering more than 90% of the skin.[10] Some people experience gastrointestinal issues, with abdominal pain and vomiting. Others experience eye problems, namely sensitivity to light, conjunctivitis, and pain behind the eye.[11] This first set of symptoms – called the \"acute phase\" of Chikungunya – lasts around a week, after which most symptoms resolve on their own.[11] Many people continue to have symptoms after the \"acute phase\" resolves, termed the \"post-acute phase\" for symptoms lasting three weeks to three months, and the \"chronic stage\" for symptoms lasting longer than three months.[11] In both cases, the lasting symptoms tend to be joint pains: arthritis, tenosynovitis, and/or bursitis.[11] If the affected person had pre-existing joint issues, these tend to worsen.[11] Overuse of a joint can result in painful swelling, stiffness, nerve damage, and neuropathic pain.[11] Typically the joint pain improves with time; however, the chronic stage can last anywhere from a few months to several years.[11] Joint pain is reported in 87–98% of cases, and nearly always occurs in more than one joint, though joint swelling is uncommon.[12] Typically the affected joints are located in both arms and legs. Joints are more likely to be affected if they have previously been damaged by disorders such as arthritis.[13] Pain most commonly occurs in peripheral joints, such as the wrists, ankles, and joints of the hands and feet as well as some of the larger joints, typically the shoulders, elbows and knees.[12][13] Pain may also occur in the muscles or ligaments. In more than half of cases, normal activity is limited by significant fatigue and pain.[12] Infrequently, inflammation of the eyes may occur in the form of iridocyclitis, or uveitis, and retinal lesions may occur.[14] Temporary damage to the liver may occur.[15] People with Chikungunya occasionally develop neurologic disorders, most frequently swelling or degeneration of the brain, inflammation or degeneration of the myelin sheaths around neurons, Guillain–Barré syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, hypotonia (in newborns), and issues with visual processing.[11] In particularly rare cases, people may develop behavioral changes, seizures, irritation of the cerebellum or meninges, oculomotor nerve palsy, or paralysis of the eye muscles.[11] Newborns are susceptible to particularly severe effects of Chikungunya infection. Signs of infection typically begin with fever, rash, and swelling at the extremities.[11] Around half of newborns have a mild case of the disease that resolves on its own; the other half have severe disease with inflammation of the brain and seizures.[11] In severe cases, affected newborns may also have issues with bleeding and bloodflow, and problems with heart function.[11] In addition to newborns, the elderly, and those with diabetes, heart disease, liver and kidney diseases, and human immunodeficiency virus infection tend to have more severe cases of Chikungunya. Around 1 to 5 in 1,000 people with symptomatic Chikungunya die of the disease.[11] Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), is a member of the genus Alphavirus, and family Togaviridae. It was first isolated in 1953 in Tanzania and is an RNA virus with a positive-sense single-stranded genome of about 11.6kb.[17] It is a member of the Semliki Forest virus complex and is closely related to Ross River virus, O\\'nyong\\'nyong virus, and Semliki Forest virus.[18] Because it is transmitted by arthropods, namely mosquitoes, it can also be referred to as an arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus). In the United States, it is classified as a category B priority pathogen,[19] and work requires biosafety level III precautions.[20] Chikungunya is generally transmitted from mosquitoes to humans. Less common modes of transmission include vertical transmission, which is transmission from mother to child during pregnancy or at birth. Transmission via infected blood products and through organ donation is also theoretically possible during times of outbreak, though no cases have yet been documented.[13] The incubation period ranges from one to twelve days, and is most typically three to seven.[12] Chikungunya is related to mosquitoes, their environments, and human behavior. The adaptation of mosquitoes to the changing climate of North Africa around 5,000 years ago made them seek out environments where humans stored water. Human habitation and the mosquitoes\\' environments were then very closely connected. During periods of epidemics humans are the reservoir of the virus. Because high amounts of virus are present in the blood in the beginning of acute infection, the virus can be spread from a viremic human to a mosquito, and back to a human.[21] During other times, monkeys, birds and other vertebrates have served as reservoirs.[22] Three genotypes of this virus have been described, each with a distinct genotype and antigenic character: West African, East/Central/South African, and Asian genotypes.[23] The Asian lineage originated in 1952 and has subsequently split into two lineages – India (Indian Ocean Lineage) and South East Asian clades. This virus was first reported in the Americas in 2014. Phylogenetic investigations have shown that there are two strains in Brazil – the Asian and East/Central/South African types – and that the Asian strain arrived in the Caribbean (most likely from Oceania) in about March 2013.[24] The rate of molecular evolution was estimated to have a mean rate of 5 × 10−4 substitutions per site per year (95% higher probability density 2.9–7.9 × 10−4).[24] Chikungunya is spread through bites from Aedes mosquitoes, and the species A. aegypti was identified as the most common vector, though the virus has recently been associated with many other species, including A. albopictus.[13] Research by the Pasteur Institute in Paris has suggested Chikungunya virus strains in the 2005-2006 Reunion Island outbreak incurred a mutation that facilitated transmission by the Asian tiger mosquito (A. albopictus).[25] Other species potentially able to transmit Chikungunya virus include Ae. furcifer-taylori, Ae. africanus, and Ae. luteocephalus.[13] Chikungunya virus is passed to humans when a bite from an infected mosquito breaks the skin and introduces the virus into the body.  The pathogenesis of chikungunya infection in humans is still poorly understood, despite recent outbreaks. It appears that in vitro, Chikungunya virus is able to replicate in human epithelial and endothelial cells, primary fibroblasts, and monocyte-derived macrophages. Viral replication is highly cytopathic, but susceptible to type-I and -II interferon.[26] In vivo, in studies using living cells, chikungunya virus appears to replicate in fibroblasts, skeletal muscle progenitor cells, and myofibers.[27][28][29] The type-1 interferon response seems to play an important role in the host\\'s response to chikungunya infection. Upon infection with chikungunya, the host\\'s fibroblasts produce type-1 alpha and beta interferon (IFN-α and IFN-β).[5][28] In mouse studies, deficiencies in INF-1 in mice exposed to the virus cause increased morbidity and mortality.[28][30][31] The chikungunya-specific upstream components of the type-1 interferon pathway involved in the host\\'s response to chikungunya infection are still unknown.[32] Nonetheless, mouse studies suggest that IPS-1 is an important factor,[32] and that IRF3 and IRF7 are important in an age-dependent manner.[33][34] Mouse studies also suggest that chikungunya evades host defenses and counters the type-I interferon response by producing NS2, a nonstructural protein that degrades RBP1 and turns off the host cell\\'s ability to transcribe DNA.[35] NS2 interferes with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and prevents STAT from becoming phosphorylated.[36] In the acute phase of chikungunya, the virus is typically present in the areas where symptoms present, specifically skeletal muscles, and joints. In the chronic phase, it is suggested that viral persistence (the inability of the body to entirely rid itself of the virus), lack of clearance of the antigen, or both, contribute to joint pain. The inflammation response during both the acute and chronic phase of the disease results in part from interactions between the virus and monocytes and macrophages.[37] Chikungunya virus disease in humans is associated with elevated serum levels of specific cytokines and chemokines. High levels of specific cytokines have been linked to more severe acute disease: interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, RANTES, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG), and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10). Cytokines may also contribute to chronic Chikungunya virus disease, as persistent joint pain has been associated with elevated levels of IL-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).[21] In those with chronic symptoms, a mild elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) has been observed, suggesting ongoing chronic inflammation. However, there is little evidence linking chronic Chikungunya virus disease and the development of autoimmunity.[citation needed][38] The virus consists of four nonstructural proteins and three structural proteins.[37] The structural proteins are the capsid and two envelope glycoproteins: E1 and E2, which form heterodimeric spikes on the viron surface. E2 binds to cellular receptors in order to enter the host cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. E1 contains a fusion peptide which, when exposed to the acidity of the endosome in eukaryotic cells, dissociates from E2 and initiates membrane fusion that allows the release of nucleocapsids into the host cytoplasm, promoting infection.[39] The mature virion contains 240 heterodimeric spikes of E2/E1, which after release, bud on the surface of the infected cell, where they are released by exocytosis to infect other cells.[17] Chikungunya is diagnosed on the basis of clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory criteria. Clinically, acute onset of high fever and severe joint pain would lead to suspicion of chikungunya. Epidemiological criteria consist of whether the individual has traveled to or spent time in an area in which chikungunya is present within the last twelve days (i.e.) the potential incubation period). Laboratory criteria include a decreased lymphocyte count consistent with viremia. However a definitive laboratory diagnosis can be accomplished through viral isolation, RT-PCR, or serological diagnosis.[40] The differential diagnosis may include other mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue or malaria, or other infections such as influenza. Chronic recurrent polyarthralgia occurs in at least 20% of chikungunya patients one year after infection, whereas such symptoms are uncommon in dengue.[41] Virus isolation provides the most definitive diagnosis, but takes one to two weeks for completion and must be carried out in biosafety level III laboratories.[42] The technique involves exposing specific cell lines to samples from whole blood and identifying Chikungunya virus-specific responses. RT-PCR using nested primer pairs is used to amplify several chikungunya-specific genes from whole blood, generating thousands to millions of copies of the genes in order to identify them. RT-PCR can also be used to quantify the viral load in the blood. Using RT-PCR, diagnostic results can be available in one to two days.[42] Serological diagnosis requires a larger amount of blood than the other methods, and uses an ELISA assay to measure chikungunya-specific IgM levels in the blood serum. One advantage offered by serological diagnosis is that serum IgM is detectable from 5 days to months after the onset of symptoms, but drawbacks are that results may require two to three days, and false positives can occur with infection due to other related viruses, such as o\\'nyong\\'nyong virus and Semliki Forest virus.[42] Presently, there is no specific way to test for chronic signs and symptoms associated with Chikungunya fever although nonspecific laboratory findings such as C reactive protein and elevated cytokines can correlate with disease activity.[43] Because no approved vaccine exists, the most effective means of prevention are protection against contact with the disease-carrying mosquitoes and controlling mosquito populations by limiting their habitat.[4] Mosquito control focuses on eliminating the standing water where mosquitos lay eggs and develop as larva; if elimination of the standing water is not possible, insecticides or biological control agents can be added.[37] Methods of protection against contact with mosquitos include using insect repellents with substances such as DEET, icaridin, PMD (p-menthane-3,8-diol, a substance derived from the lemon eucalyptus tree), or ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate (IR3535). However, increasing insecticide resistance presents a challenge to chemical control methods.[citation needed] Wearing bite-proof long sleeves and trousers also offers protection, and garments can be treated with pyrethroids, a class of insecticides that often has repellent properties. Vaporized pyrethroids (for example in mosquito coils) are also insect repellents. As infected mosquitoes often feed and rest inside homes, securing screens on windows and doors will help to keep mosquitoes out of the house. In the case of the day-active A. aegypti and A. albopictus, however, this will have only a limited effect, since many contacts between the mosquitoes and humans occur outdoors.[citation needed] As of 2021[update], no approved vaccines are available. A phase-II vaccine trial used a live, attenuated virus, to develop viral resistance in 98% of those tested after 28 days and 85% still showed resistance after one year.[44] However, 8% of people reported transient joint pain, and attenuation was found to be due to only two mutations in the E2 glycoprotein.[45] Alternative vaccine strategies have been developed, and show efficacy in mouse models.[46][47] In August 2014 researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the USA were testing an experimental vaccine which uses virus-like particles (VLPs) instead of attenuated virus.  All the 25 people participated in this phase 1 trial developed strong immune responses.[48] As of 2015, a phase 2 trial was planned, using 400 adults aged 18 to 60 and to take place at 6 locations in the Caribbean.[49] Even with a vaccine, mosquito population control and bite prevention will be necessary to control chikungunya disease.[50] In 2021, two vaccine manufacturers, one in France, the other in the United States, reported successful completion of Phase II clinical trials.[51][52] Currently, no specific treatment for chikungunya is available.[4] Supportive care is recommended, and symptomatic treatment of fever and joint swelling includes the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, non-aspirin analgesics such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and fluids.[4] Aspirin is not recommended due to the increased risk of bleeding.[53] Despite anti-inflammatory effects, corticosteroids are not recommended during the acute phase of disease, as they may cause immunosuppression and worsen infection.[13] Passive immunotherapy has potential benefit in treatment of chikungunya. Studies in animals using passive immunotherapy have been effective, and clinical studies using passive immunotherapy in those particularly vulnerable to severe infection are currently in progress.[54] Passive immunotherapy involves administration of anti-CHIKV hyperimmune human intravenous antibodies (immunoglobulins) to those exposed to a high risk of chikungunya infection. No antiviral treatment for Chikungunya virus is currently available, though testing has shown several medications to be effective in vitro.[12] In those who have more than two weeks of arthritis, ribavirin may be useful.[4] The effect of chloroquine is not clear.[4] It does not appear to help acute disease, but tentative evidence indicates it might help those with chronic arthritis.[4] Steroids do not appear to be an effective treatment.[4] NSAIDs and simple analgesics can be used to provide partial symptom relief in most cases. Methotrexate, a drug used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, has been shown to have benefit in treating inflammatory polyarthritis resulting from chikungunya, though the drug mechanism for improving viral arthritis is unclear.[55] The mortality rate of chikungunya is slightly less than 1 in 1000.[56] Those over the age of 65, neonates, and those with underlying chronic medical problems are most likely to have severe complications.[21] Neonates are vulnerable as it is possible to vertically transmit chikungunya from mother to infant during delivery, which results in high rates of morbidity, as infants lack fully developed immune systems.[21] The likelihood of prolonged symptoms or chronic joint pain is increased with increased age and prior rheumatological disease.[57][58] Historically, chikungunya has been present mostly in the developing world. The disease causes an estimated 3 million infections each year.[59] Epidemics in the Indian Ocean, Pacific Islands, and in the Americas, continue to change the distribution of the disease.[60] In Africa, chikungunya is spread by a sylvatic cycle in which the virus largely cycles between other non-human primates, small mammals, and mosquitos between human outbreaks.[61] During outbreaks, due to the high concentration of virus in the blood of those in the acute phase of infection, the virus can circulate from humans to mosquitoes and back to humans.[61] The transmission of the pathogen between humans and mosquitoes that exist in urban environments was established on multiple occasions from strains occurring on the eastern half of Africa in non-human primate hosts.[37] This emergence and spread beyond Africa may have started as early as the 18th century.[37] Currently, available data does not indicate whether the introduction of chikungunya into Asia occurred in the 19th century or more recently, but this epidemic Asian strain causes outbreaks in India and continues to circulate in Southeast Asia.[37] In Africa, outbreaks were typically tied to heavy rainfall causing increased mosquito population. In recent outbreaks in urban centers, the virus has spread by circulating between humans and mosquitoes.[13] Global rates of chikungunya infection are variable, depending on outbreaks. When chikungunya was first identified in 1952, it had a low-level circulation in West Africa, with infection rates linked to rainfall. Beginning in the 1960s, periodic outbreaks were documented in Asia and Africa. However, since 2005, following several decades of relative inactivity, chikungunya has re-emerged and caused large outbreaks in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. In India, for instance, chikungunya re-appeared following 32 years of absence of viral activity.[62] Outbreaks have occurred in Europe, the Caribbean, and South America, areas in which chikungunya was not previously transmitted. Local transmission has also occurred in the United States and Australia, countries in which the virus was previously unknown.[13] In 2005, an outbreak on the island of Réunion was the largest then documented, with an estimated 266,000 cases on an island with a population of approximately 770,000.[63] In a 2006 outbreak, India reported 1.25 million suspected cases.[64] Chikungunya was introduced to the Americas in 2013, first detected on the French island of Saint Martin,[65] and for the next two years in the Americas, 1,118,763 suspected cases and 24,682 confirmed cases were reported by the PAHO.[66] An analysis of the genetic code of Chikungunya virus suggests that the increased severity of the 2005–present outbreak may be due to a change in the genetic sequence which altered the E1 segment of the virus\\' viral coat protein, a variant called E1-A226V. This mutation potentially allows the virus to multiply more easily in mosquito cells.[67] The change allows the virus to use the Asian tiger mosquito (an invasive species) as a vector in addition to the more strictly tropical main vector, Aedes aegypti.[68] Enhanced transmission of Chikungunya virus by A. albopictus could mean an increased risk for outbreaks in other areas where the Asian tiger mosquito is present.[69] A albopictus is an invasive species which has spread through Europe, the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa and the Middle East.[citation needed] After the detection of zika virus in Brazil in April 2015, the first ever in the Western Hemisphere,[70][71] it is now thought some chikungunya and dengue cases could in fact be zika virus cases or coinfections. The word \\'chikungunya\\' is believed to have been derived from a description in the Makonde language, meaning \"that which bends up\", of the contorted posture of people affected with the severe joint pain and arthritic symptoms associated with this disease.[72] The disease was first described by Marion Robinson[73] and W.H.R. Lumsden[74] in 1955, following an outbreak in 1952 on the Makonde Plateau, along the border between Mozambique and Tanganyika (the mainland part of modern-day Tanzania).[citation needed] According to the initial 1955 report about the epidemiology of the disease, the term \\'chikungunya\\' is derived from the Makonde root verb kungunyala, meaning to dry up or become contorted. In concurrent research, Robinson glossed the Makonde term more specifically as \"that which bends up\". Subsequent authors apparently overlooked the references to the Makonde language and assumed the term to have been derived from Swahili, the lingua franca of the region. The erroneous attribution to Swahili has been repeated in numerous print sources.[75] Erroneous spellings of the name of the disease are also in common use.[citation needed] Since its discovery in Tanganyika, Africa, in 1952, Chikungunya virus outbreaks have occurred occasionally in Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, but recent outbreaks have spread the disease over a wider range.[citation needed] The first recorded outbreak of this disease may have been in 1779.[76] This is in agreement with the molecular genetics evidence that suggests it evolved around the year 1700.[77] Chikungunya is one of more than a dozen agents researched as a potential biological weapon.[78][79] This disease is part of the group of neglected tropical diseases.[80]  Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus.[1] Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection.[2] These may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin itching and skin rash.[1][2] Recovery generally takes two to seven days.[1] In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into a more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.[1][2] Dengue is spread by several species of female mosquitoes of the Aedes genus, principally Aedes aegypti.[1][2] The virus has five serotypes;[9][10] infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others.[1] Subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications.[1] A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.[2] Two types of dengue vaccine have been approved and are commercially available.[6][11] On 5 December 2022 the European Medicines Agency approved Qdenga, a live tetravalent attenuated vaccine for adults, adolescents and kids from four years of age.[11] The 2016 vaccine Dengvaxia is only recommended in individuals who have been previously infected, or in populations with a high rate of prior infection by age nine.[12][7] Other methods of prevention include reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites.[1] This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body.[1] Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease.[2] For more severe cases, blood transfusion may be required.[2] Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is recommended instead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for fever reduction and pain relief in dengue due to an increased risk of bleeding from NSAID use.[2][13][14] The earliest descriptions of an outbreak date from 1779.[15] Its viral cause and spread were understood by the early 20th century.[16] Dengue has become a global problem since the Second World War and is common in more than 120 countries, mainly in Southeast Asia, South Asia and South America.[7][17][15] About 390\\xa0million people are infected per year, about half a million require hospital admission,[1] and approximately 40,000 die.[7][8] In 2019, a significant increase in the number of cases was seen.[18] Apart from eliminating the mosquitos, work is ongoing for medication targeted directly at the virus.[19] It is classified as a neglected tropical disease.[20] Typically, people infected with dengue virus are asymptomatic (80%) or have only mild symptoms such as an uncomplicated fever.[22][23][24] Others have more severe illness (5%), and in a small proportion it is life-threatening.[22][24] The incubation period (time between exposure and onset of symptoms) ranges from 3 to 14 days, but most often it is 4 to 7 days.[25] Therefore, travelers returning from endemic areas are unlikely to have dengue fever if symptoms start more than 14\\xa0days after arriving home.[17] Children often experience symptoms similar to those of the common cold and gastroenteritis (vomiting and diarrhea)[26] and have a greater risk of severe complications,[17][27] though initial symptoms are generally mild but include high fever.[27] The characteristic symptoms of dengue are sudden-onset fever, headache (typically located behind the eyes), muscle and joint pains, and a rash. An alternative name for dengue, \"breakbone fever\", comes from the associated muscle and joint pains.[22][28] The course of infection is divided into three phases: febrile, critical, and recovery.[21] The febrile phase involves high fever, potentially over 40\\xa0°C (104\\xa0°F), and is associated with generalized pain and a headache; this usually lasts two to seven days.[21][28] Nausea and vomiting may also occur.[27] A rash occurs in 50–80% of those with symptoms[28][29] in the first or second day of symptoms as flushed skin, or later in the course of illness (days 4–7), as a measles-like rash.[29][30] A rash described as \"islands of white in a sea of red\" has also been observed.[31] Some petechiae (small red spots that do not disappear when the skin is pressed, which are caused by broken capillaries) can appear at this point,[21] as may some mild bleeding from the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose.[17][28] The fever itself is classically biphasic or saddleback in nature, breaking and then returning for one or two days.[30][31] In some people, the disease proceeds to a critical phase as fever resolves.[27] During this period, there is leakage of plasma from the blood vessels, typically lasting one to two days.[21] This may result in fluid accumulation in the chest and abdominal cavity as well as depletion of fluid from the circulation and decreased blood supply to vital organs.[21] There may also be organ dysfunction and severe bleeding, typically from the gastrointestinal tract.[17][21] Shock (dengue shock syndrome) and hemorrhage (dengue hemorrhagic fever) occur in less than 5% of all cases of dengue;[17] however, those who have previously been infected with other serotypes of dengue virus (\"secondary infection\") are at an increased risk.[17][32] This critical phase, while rare, occurs relatively more commonly in children and young adults.[27] The recovery phase occurs next, with resorption of the leaked fluid into the bloodstream.[21] This usually lasts two to three days.[17] The improvement is often striking, and can be accompanied with severe itching and a slow heart rate.[17][21] Another rash may occur with either a maculopapular or a vasculitic appearance, which is followed by peeling of the skin.[27] During this stage, a fluid overload state may occur; if it affects the brain, it may cause a reduced level of consciousness or seizures.[17] A feeling of fatigue may last for weeks in adults.[27] Dengue can occasionally affect several other body systems,[21] either in isolation or along with the classic dengue symptoms.[26] A decreased level of consciousness occurs in 0.5–6% of severe cases, which is attributable either to inflammation of the brain by the virus or indirectly as a result of impairment of vital organs, for example, the liver.[26][31][33] Other neurological disorders have been reported in the context of dengue, such as transverse myelitis and Guillain–Barré syndrome.[26][33] Infection of the heart and acute liver failure are among the rarer complications.[17][21] A pregnant woman who develops dengue is at higher risk of miscarriage, low birth weight birth, and premature birth.[34] Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus. Other members of the same genus include yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus.[31] Most are transmitted by arthropods (mosquitos or ticks), and are therefore also referred to as arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses).[31] The dengue virus genome (genetic material) contains about 11,000 nucleotide bases, which code for the three different types of protein molecules (C, prM and E) that form the virus particle and seven other non-structural protein molecules (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5) that are found in infected host cells only and are required for replication of the virus.[32][35] There are five[9] strains of the virus, called serotypes, of which the first four are referred to as DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4.[23] The fifth type was announced in 2013.[9] The distinctions between the serotypes are based on their antigenicity.[36] Dengue virus is primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitos, particularly A. aegypti.[23] These mosquitos usually live between the latitudes of 35°\\xa0North and 35°\\xa0South below an elevation of 1,000 metres (3,300\\xa0ft).[23] They typically bite during the early morning and in the evening,[37][38] but they may bite and thus spread infection at any time of day.[39] Other Aedes species that transmit the disease include A. albopictus, A. polynesiensis and A. scutellaris.[23] Humans are the primary host of the virus,[23][31] but it also circulates in nonhuman primates.[40] An infection can be acquired via a single bite.[41] A female mosquito that takes a blood meal from a person infected with dengue fever, during the initial 2- to 10-day febrile period, becomes itself infected with the virus in the cells lining its gut.[42] About 8–10 days later, the virus spreads to other tissues including the mosquito\\'s salivary glands and is subsequently released into its saliva. The virus seems to have no detrimental effect on the mosquito, which remains infected for life.[25] Aedes aegypti is particularly involved, as it prefers to lay its eggs in artificial water containers, to live in close proximity to humans, and to feed on people rather than other vertebrates.[25] Dengue can also be transmitted via infected blood products and through organ donation.[43][44][45] In countries such as Singapore, where dengue is endemic, the risk is estimated to be between 1.6 and 6 per 10,000 transfusions.[43] Vertical transmission (from mother to child) during pregnancy or at birth has been reported.[46] Other person-to-person modes of transmission, including sexual transmission, have also been reported, but are very unusual.[28][47] The genetic variation in dengue viruses is region specific, suggestive that establishment into new territories is relatively infrequent, despite dengue emerging in new regions in recent decades.[27] Severe disease is more common in babies and young children, and in contrast to many other infections, it is more common in children who are relatively well nourished.[17] Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index,[27] and viral load.[48] While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease,[32] virus strain is a risk factor.[27] Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three.[23][28] The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2.[35] Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.[35] Polymorphisms (normal variations) in particular genes have been linked with an increased risk of severe dengue complications. Examples include the genes coding for the proteins TNFα, mannan-binding lectin,[22] CTLA4, TGFβ,[32] DC-SIGN, PLCE1, and particular forms of human leukocyte antigen from gene variations of HLA-B.[27][35] A common genetic abnormality, especially in Africans, known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, appears to increase the risk.[48] Polymorphisms in the genes for the vitamin D receptor and FcγR seem to offer protection against severe disease in secondary dengue infection.[35] When a mosquito carrying dengue virus bites a person, the virus enters the skin together with the mosquito\\'s saliva. It binds to and enters white blood cells, and reproduces inside the cells while they move throughout the body. The white blood cells respond by producing several signaling proteins, such as cytokines and interferons, which are responsible for many of the symptoms, such as the fever, the flu-like symptoms, and the severe pains. In severe infection, the virus production inside the body is greatly increased, and many more organs (such as the liver and the bone marrow) can be affected. Fluid from the bloodstream leaks through the wall of small blood vessels into body cavities due to capillary permeability. As a result, less blood circulates in the blood vessels, and the blood pressure becomes so low that it cannot supply sufficient blood to vital organs. Furthermore, dysfunction of the bone marrow due to infection of the stromal cells leads to reduced numbers of platelets, which are necessary for effective blood clotting; this increases the risk of bleeding, the other major complication of dengue fever.[48] Once inside the skin, dengue virus binds to Langerhans cells (a population of dendritic cells in the skin that identifies pathogens).[48] The virus enters the cells through binding between viral proteins and membrane proteins on the Langerhans cell, specifically, the C-type lectins called DC-SIGN, mannose receptor and CLEC5A.[32] DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, seems to be the main point of entry.[35] The dendritic cell moves to the nearest lymph node. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell\\'s endoplasmic reticulum, where the cell\\'s protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral RNA and begin to form viral particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the Golgi apparatus, the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains (glycoproteins). The now mature new viruses are released by exocytosis. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as monocytes and macrophages.[32] The initial reaction of infected cells is to produce interferon, a cytokine that raises many defenses against viral infection through the innate immune system by augmenting the production of a large group of proteins mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway. Some serotypes of the dengue virus appear to have mechanisms to slow down this process. Interferon also activates the adaptive immune system, which leads to the generation of antibodies against the virus as well as T cells that directly attack any cell infected with the virus.[32] Various antibodies are generated; some bind closely to the viral proteins and target them for phagocytosis (ingestion by specialized cells and destruction), but some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not destroyed but can replicate further.[32] It is not entirely clear why secondary infection with a different strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The exact mechanism behind ADE is unclear. It may be caused by poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have ingested the virus for destruction.[32][35] There is a suspicion that ADE is not the only mechanism underlying severe dengue-related complications,[22][33] and various lines of research have implied a role for T cells and soluble factors such as cytokines and the complement system.[48] Severe disease is marked by the problems of capillary permeability (an allowance of fluid and protein normally contained within the blood to pass) and disordered blood clotting.[26][27] These changes appear associated with a disordered state of the endothelial glycocalyx, which acts as a molecular filter of blood components.[27] Leaky capillaries (and the critical phase) are thought to be caused by an immune system response.[27] Other processes of interest include infected cells that become necrotic—which affect both coagulation and fibrinolysis (the opposing systems of blood clotting and clot degradation)—and low platelets in the blood, also a factor in normal clotting.[48] The diagnosis of dengue is typically made clinically, on the basis of reported symptoms and physical examination; this applies especially in endemic areas.[22] However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other viral infections.[17] A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: nausea and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, low white blood cell count, positive tourniquet test, or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an endemic area.[49] Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue.[21] The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the application of a blood pressure cuff at between the diastolic and systolic pressure for five minutes, followed by the counting of any petechial hemorrhages; a higher number makes a diagnosis of dengue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1\\xa0inch2 (6.25\\xa0cm2).[21][50] The diagnosis should be considered in anyone who develops a fever within two weeks of being in the tropics or subtropics.[27] It can be difficult to distinguish dengue fever and chikungunya, a similar viral infection that shares many symptoms and occurs in similar parts of the world to dengue.[28] Often, investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as malaria, leptospirosis, viral hemorrhagic fever, typhoid fever, meningococcal disease, measles, and influenza.[17][51] Zika fever also has similar symptoms as dengue.[52] The earliest change detectable on laboratory investigations is a low white blood cell count, which may then be followed by low platelets and metabolic acidosis.[17] A moderately elevated level of aminotransferase (AST and ALT) from the liver is commonly associated with low platelets and white blood cells.[27] In severe disease, plasma leakage results in hemoconcentration (as indicated by a rising hematocrit) and hypoalbuminemia.[17] Pleural effusions or ascites can be detected by physical examination when large,[17] but the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome.[17][22] The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings.[22] Dengue shock syndrome is present if pulse pressure drops to ≤\\xa020\\xa0mm\\xa0Hg along with peripheral vascular collapse.[27] Peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed capillary refill, rapid heart rate, or cold extremities.[21] While warning signs are an important aspect for early detection of potential serious disease, the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak.[53] The World Health Organization\\'s 2009 classification divides dengue fever into two groups: uncomplicated and severe.[22][49] This replaces the 1997 WHO classification, which needed to be simplified as it had been found to be too restrictive, though the older classification is still widely used[49] including by the World Health Organization\\'s Regional Office for Southeast Asia as of 2011[update].[54] Severe dengue is defined as that associated with severe bleeding, severe organ dysfunction, or severe plasma leakage while all other cases are uncomplicated.[49] The 1997 classification divided dengue into an undifferentiated fever, dengue fever, and dengue hemorrhagic fever.[17][55] Dengue hemorrhagic fever was subdivided further into grades I–IV. Grade I is the presence only of easy bruising or a positive tourniquet test in someone with fever, grade II is the presence of spontaneous bleeding into the skin and elsewhere, grade III is the clinical evidence of shock, and grade IV is shock so severe that blood pressure and pulse cannot be detected.[55] Grades III and IV are referred to as \"dengue shock syndrome\".[49][55] The diagnosis of dengue fever may be confirmed by microbiological laboratory testing.[49][56] This can be done by virus isolation in cell cultures, nucleic acid detection by PCR, viral antigen detection (such as for NS1) or specific antibodies (serology).[35][51] Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection, but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost.[51] Detection of NS1 during the febrile phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90% sensitive however is only 60–80% in subsequent infections.[27] All tests may be negative in the early stages of the disease.[17][35] PCR and viral antigen detection are more accurate in the first seven days.[27] In 2012 a PCR test was introduced that can run on equipment used to diagnose influenza; this is likely to improve access to PCR-based diagnosis.[57] These laboratory tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute phase of the illness with the exception of serology. Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types IgG and IgM, can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5–7 days. The highest levels (titres) of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also produced in reinfection. IgM becomes undetectable 30–90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following re-infections. IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection, IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14–21 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus.[25][28][35] In testing for IgG and IgM antibodies there may be cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses which may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with yellow fever virus or Japanese encephalitis.[27] The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.[25] Prevention depends on control of and protection from the bites of the mosquito that transmits it.[37][58] The World Health Organization recommends an Integrated Vector Control program consisting of five elements:[37] The primary method of controlling A. aegypti is by eliminating its habitats.[37] This is done by getting rid of open sources of water, or if this is not possible, by adding insecticides or biological control agents to these areas.[37] Generalized spraying with organophosphate or pyrethroid insecticides, while sometimes done, is not thought to be effective.[24] Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effects from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents.[37] People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using mosquito netting while resting, and/or the application of insect repellent (DEET being the most effective).[41] While these measures can be an effective means of reducing an individual\\'s risk of exposure, they do little in terms of mitigating the frequency of outbreaks, which appear to be on the rise in some areas, probably due to urbanization increasing the habitat of A. aegypti.[9] The range of the disease also appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change.[9] Two types of dengue vaccine are available: Qdenga and Dengvaxia.[6][11] On 5 December 2022 the European Medicines Agency approved Qdenga, a live tetravalent attenuated vaccine for adults, adolescents and kids from four years of age, produced by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company.[11] In 2016 Dengvaxia became commercially available in the Philippines and Indonesia.[6][59] It has been approved for use by Mexico, Brazil, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Singapore, Paraguay, much of Europe, and the United States.[60][59][61] Dengvaxia is only recommended in individuals who have had a prior dengue infection or in populations where most (>80%) of people have been infected by age 9.[12][62] In those who have not had a prior infection there is evidence it may worsen subsequent infections.[60][12][7] For this reason Prescrire does not see it as suitable for wide scale immunization, even in areas where the disease is common.[63] Dengvaxia is produced by Sanofi.[64] It is based on a weakened combination of the yellow fever virus and each of the four dengue serotypes.[38][65] Studies of the vaccine found it was 66% effective and prevented more than 80 to 90% of severe cases.[62] This is less than wished for by some.[66] In Indonesia it costs about US$207 for the recommended three doses.[59] Given the limitations of the current vaccine, research on vaccines continues, and the fifth serotype may be factored in.[9] One of the concerns is that a vaccine could increase the risk of severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).[67] The ideal vaccine is safe, effective after one or two injections, covers all serotypes, does not contribute to ADE, is easily transported and stored, and is both affordable and cost-effective.[67] International Anti-Dengue Day is observed every year on 15 June.[68] The idea was first agreed upon in 2010 with the first event held in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2011.[68] Further events were held in 2012 in Yangon, Myanmar, and in 2013 in Vietnam.[68] Goals are to increase public awareness about dengue, mobilize resources for its prevention and control and, to demonstrate the Southeast Asian region\\'s commitment in tackling the disease.[69] There are no specific antiviral drugs for dengue; however, maintaining proper fluid balance is important.[27] Treatment depends on the symptoms.[14] Those who can drink, are passing urine, have no \"warning signs\" and are otherwise healthy can be managed at home with daily follow-up and oral rehydration therapy.[14] Those who have other health problems, have \"warning signs\", or cannot manage regular follow-up should be cared for in hospital.[17][14] In those with severe dengue care should be provided in an area where there is access to an intensive care unit.[14] Intravenous hydration, if required, is typically only needed for one or two days.[14] In children with shock due to dengue a rapid dose of 20\\xa0mL/kg is reasonable.[70] The rate of fluid administration is then titrated to a urinary output of 0.5–1\\xa0mL/kg/h, stable vital signs and normalization of hematocrit.[17] The smallest amount of fluid required to achieve this is recommended.[14] Invasive medical procedures such as nasogastric intubation, intramuscular injections and arterial punctures are avoided, in view of the bleeding risk.[17] Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is used for fever and discomfort while NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and aspirin are avoided as they might aggravate the risk of bleeding.[14] Blood transfusion is initiated early in people presenting with unstable vital signs in the face of a decreasing hematocrit, rather than waiting for the hemoglobin concentration to decrease to some predetermined \"transfusion trigger\" level.[71] Packed red blood cells or whole blood are recommended, while platelets and fresh frozen plasma are usually not.[71] There is not enough evidence to determine if corticosteroids have a positive or negative effect in dengue fever.[72] During the recovery phase intravenous fluids are discontinued to prevent a state of fluid overload.[17] If fluid overload occurs and vital signs are stable, stopping further fluid may be all that is needed.[71] If a person is outside of the critical phase, a loop diuretic such as furosemide may be used to eliminate excess fluid from the circulation.[71] Most people with dengue recover without any ongoing problems.[49] The risk of death among those with severe dengue is 0.8% to 2.5%,[73] and with adequate treatment this is less than 1%.[49] However, those who develop significantly low blood pressure may have a fatality rate of up to 26%.[17] The risk of death among children less than five years old is four times greater than among those over the age of 10.[73] Elderly people are also at higher risk of a poor outcome.[73] As of 2019, dengue was common in more than 120 countries.[7] In 2013 it caused about 60 million symptomatic infections worldwide, with 18% admitted to hospital and about 13,600 deaths.[74] The worldwide cost of dengue case is estimated US$9 billion.[74] For the decade of the 2000s, 12 countries in Southeast Asia were estimated to have about 3\\xa0million infections and 6,000 deaths annually.[75] In 2019 the Philippines declared a national dengue epidemic due to the deaths reaching 622 people that year.[76] It is reported in at least 22 countries in Africa; but is likely present in all of them with 20% of the population at risk.[77] This makes it one of the most common vector-borne diseases worldwide.[53] Infections are most commonly acquired in urban environments.[25] In recent decades, the expansion of villages, towns and cities in the areas in which it is common, and the increased mobility of people has increased the number of epidemics and circulating viruses. Dengue fever, which was once confined to Southeast Asia, has now spread to southern China in East Asia, countries in the Pacific Ocean and the Americas,[25] and might pose a threat to Europe.[24] In November 2022, the first locally transmitted case of dengue was reported in Maricopa County, Arizona and Arizona state as a whole.[78] Rates of dengue increased 30\\xa0fold between 1960 and 2010.[79] This increase is believed to be due to a combination of urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and global warming.[22] The geographical distribution is around the equator. Of the 2.5\\xa0billion people living in areas where it is common 70% are from the WHO Southeast Asia Region and Western Pacific Region.[79] An infection with dengue is second only to malaria as a diagnosed cause of fever among travelers returning from the developing world.[28] It is the most common viral disease transmitted by arthropods,[32] and has a disease burden estimated at 1,600 disability-adjusted life years per million population.[35] The World Health Organization counts dengue as one of seventeen neglected tropical diseases.[80] Like most arboviruses, dengue virus is maintained in nature in cycles that involve preferred blood-sucking vectors and vertebrate hosts.[25] The viruses are maintained in the forests of Southeast Asia and Africa by transmission from female Aedes mosquitos—of species other than A. aegypti—to their offspring and to lower primates.[25] In towns and cities, the virus is primarily transmitted by the highly domesticated A. aegypti. In rural settings the virus is transmitted to humans by A. aegypti and other species of Aedes such as A. albopictus.[25] Both these species had expanding ranges in the second half of the 20th century.[27] In all settings the infected lower primates or humans greatly increase the number of circulating dengue viruses, in a process called amplification.[25] One projection estimates that climate change, urbanization, and other factors could result in more than 6 billion people at risk of dengue infection by 2080.[81] The first record of a case of probable dengue fever is in a Chinese medical encyclopedia from the Jin Dynasty (266–420) which referred to a \"water poison\" associated with flying insects.[15][82] The primary vector, A. aegypti, spread out of Africa in the 15th to 19th centuries due in part to increased globalization secondary to the slave trade.[27] There have been descriptions of epidemics in the 17th century, but the most plausible early reports of dengue epidemics are from 1779 and 1780, when an epidemic swept across Southeast Asia, Africa and North America.[15][83] From that time until 1940, epidemics were infrequent.[15] In 1906, transmission by the Aedes mosquitos was confirmed, and in 1907 dengue was the second disease (after yellow fever) that was shown to be caused by a virus.[16] Further investigations by John Burton Cleland and Joseph Franklin Siler completed the basic understanding of dengue transmission.[16] The marked spread of dengue during and after the Second World War has been attributed to ecologic disruption. The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas and the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever. This severe form of the disease was first reported in the Philippines in 1953; by the 1970s, it had become a major cause of child mortality and had emerged in the Pacific and the Americas.[15] Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first noted in Central and South America in 1981, as DENV-2 was contracted by people who had previously been infected with DENV-1 several years earlier.[31] The name came into English in the early 19th century from West Indian Spanish, which borrowed it from the Kiswahili term dinga (in full kidingapopo, \"disease caused by an evil spirit\"). The borrowed term changed to dengue in Spanish due to this word existing in Spanish with the meaning \"fastidiousness\" and this folk etymology referring to the dislike of movement by affected patients.[84][82] Slaves in the West Indies having contracted dengue were said to have the posture and gait of a dandy, and the disease was known as \"dandy fever\".[85][86] The term break-bone fever was applied by physician and United States Founding Father Benjamin Rush, in a 1789 report of the 1780 epidemic in Philadelphia. In the report title he uses the more formal term \"bilious remitting fever\".[87] The term dengue fever came into general use only after 1828.[86] Other historical terms include \"breakheart fever\" and \"la dengue\".[86] Terms for severe disease include \"infectious thrombocytopenic purpura\" and \"Philippine\", \"Thai\", or \"Singapore hemorrhagic fever\".[86] Outbreaks of dengue fever increase the need for blood products while decreasing the number of potential blood donors due to potential infection with the virus.[88] Someone who has a dengue infection is typically not allowed to donate blood for at least the next six months.[88] A National Dengue Day is held in India on 16 May in an effort to raise awareness in affected countries.[89] Efforts are ongoing as of 2019 to make it a global event.[90] The Philippines has an awareness month in June since 1998.[91][92] Research efforts to prevent and treat dengue include various means of vector control,[needs update][93] vaccine development, and antiviral drugs.[58][needs update] A vaccine candidate, TAK-003, has shown 73% efficacy in a clinical trial of more than 20,000 children in endemic regions and 90% efficacy for hospitalized patients.[94] With regards to vector control, a number of novel methods have been used to reduce mosquito numbers with some success including the placement of the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) or copepods in standing water to eat the mosquito larvae.[93] There are also trials with genetically modified male A.\\xa0aegypti that after release into the wild mate with females, and render their offspring unable to fly.[95] In 2021 research in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, infected A. aegypti with the wMel strain of Wolbachia pipientis. Infected mosquitos were less susceptible to dengue virus infection. Odds ratio of intervention clusters versus control clusters was .23 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15 to 0.35; P=0.004).[96] Apart from the attempts to control the spread of the Aedes mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop antiviral drugs that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications.[19][97] Discovery of the structure of the viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs.[19] There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, it may be possible to develop specific inhibitors of the viral protease (coded by NS3), which splices viral proteins.[98] Finally, it may be possible to develop entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ capping process, which is required for viral replication.[97] Carica papaya leaf extract has been studied[99] and has been used for treatment[100] and in hospitals.[101] As of 2020, studies have shown positive benefits on clinical blood parameters, but a beneficial effect on disease outcome has yet to be studied,[102] and papaya leaf extract is not considered a standard of practice therapy.[99][101][103] In october 2021, the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium announced it has developed an antiviral in cooperation with Janssen Pharmaceutica, which can also be used to prevent the disease.[104]  This article was submitted to Open Medicine for external academic peer review in 2012 (reviewer reports).

Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals.[5][6][3] Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches.[1][7] In severe cases, it can cause jaundice, seizures, coma, or death.[1] Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.[3] If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.[3] In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms.[1] This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.[1] Malaria is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the Plasmodium group.[3] It is spread exclusively through bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes.[3][8] The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito\\'s saliva into a person\\'s blood.[3] The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce.[1] Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans.[1] Most deaths are caused by P.\\xa0falciparum, whereas P.\\xa0vivax, P.\\xa0ovale, and P.\\xa0malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria.[1][3] The species P.\\xa0knowlesi rarely causes disease in humans.[3] Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests.[1] Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite\\'s DNA have been developed, but they are not widely used in areas where malaria is common, due to their cost and complexity.[9] The risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites through the use of mosquito nets and insect repellents or with mosquito-control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water.[1] Several medications are available to prevent malaria for travellers in areas where the disease is common.[3] Occasional doses of the combination medication sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the first trimester of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria.[3] As of 2020, there is one vaccine which has been shown to reduce the risk of malaria by about 40% in children in Africa.[10][11] A pre-print study of another vaccine has shown 77% vaccine efficacy.[needs update][12] Efforts to develop more effective vaccines are ongoing.[11] The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes artemisinin.[13][4][1][3] The second medication may be either mefloquine, lumefantrine, or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine.[14] Quinine, along with doxycycline, may be used if artemisinin is not available.[14] It is recommended that in areas where the disease is common, malaria is confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing drug resistance.[3] Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example, chloroquine-resistant P.\\xa0falciparum has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia.[3] The disease is widespread in the tropical and subtropical regions that exist in a broad band around the equator.[15][1] This includes much of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America.[3] In 2021 there were 247 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 619,000 deaths. Approximately 95% of the cases and deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. Rates of disease decreased from 2010 to 2014 but increased from 2015 to 2021.[4] Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a significant negative effect on economic development.[16][17] In Africa, it is estimated to result in losses of US$12\\xa0billion a year due to increased healthcare costs, lost ability to work, and adverse effects on tourism.[18] Adults with malaria tend to experience chills and fever – classically in periodic intense bouts lasting around six hours, followed by a period of sweating and fever relief – as well as headache, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and muscle pain.[20] Children tend to have more general symptoms: fever, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea.[20] Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to flu-like symptoms,[21] and can resemble other conditions such as sepsis, gastroenteritis, and viral diseases.[9] The presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, joint pain, vomiting, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, hemoglobin in the urine, retinal damage, and convulsions.[22] The classic symptom of malaria is paroxysm—a cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by shivering and then fever and sweating, occurring every two days (tertian fever) in P.\\xa0vivax and P.\\xa0ovale infections, and every three days (quartan fever) for P.\\xa0malariae. P.\\xa0falciparum infection can cause recurrent fever every 36–48 hours, or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever.[23] Symptoms typically begin 10–15 days after the initial mosquito bite, but can occur as late as several months after infection with some P. vivax strains.[20] Travellers taking preventative malaria medications may develop symptoms once they stop taking the drugs.[20] Severe malaria is usually caused by P.\\xa0falciparum (often referred to as falciparum malaria). Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9–30 days after infection.[21] Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit neurological symptoms, including abnormal posturing, nystagmus, conjugate gaze palsy (failure of the eyes to turn together in the same direction), opisthotonus, seizures, or coma.[21] Malaria has several serious complications. Among these is the development of respiratory distress, which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe P.\\xa0falciparum malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis, noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, concomitant pneumonia, and severe anaemia. Although rare in young children with severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women.[24] Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality.[25] Kidney failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where haemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.[21] Infection with P.\\xa0falciparum may result in cerebral malaria, a form of severe malaria that involves encephalopathy. It is associated with retinal whitening, which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever.[26] An enlarged spleen, enlarged liver or both of these, severe headache, low blood sugar, and haemoglobin in the urine with kidney failure may occur.[21] Complications may include spontaneous bleeding, coagulopathy, and shock.[27] Malaria in pregnant women is an important cause of stillbirths, infant mortality, miscarriage and low birth weight,[28] particularly in P.\\xa0falciparum infection, but also with P.\\xa0vivax.[29] Malaria is caused by infection with parasites in the genus Plasmodium.[30] In humans, malaria is caused by six Plasmodium species: P.\\xa0falciparum, P.\\xa0malariae, P.\\xa0ovale curtisi, P.\\xa0ovale wallikeri, P.\\xa0vivax and P.\\xa0knowlesi.[31] Among those infected, P.\\xa0falciparum is the most common species identified (~75%) followed by P.\\xa0vivax (~20%).[9] Although P.\\xa0falciparum traditionally accounts for the majority of deaths,[32] recent evidence suggests that P.\\xa0vivax malaria is associated with potentially life-threatening conditions about as often as with a diagnosis of P. falciparum infection.[33] P.\\xa0vivax proportionally is more common outside Africa.[34] There have been documented human infections with several species of Plasmodium from higher apes; however, except for P.\\xa0knowlesi—a zoonotic species that causes malaria in macaques[35]—these are mostly of limited public health importance.[36] Parasites are typically introduced by the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. What these inoculated parasites, called \"sporozoites\", do in the skin and lymphatics, exactly, has yet to be accurately determined.[37] However, a percentage of sporozoites follow the bloodstream to the liver, where they invade hepatocytes.[38] They grow and divide in the liver for 2–10 days, with each infected hepatocyte eventually harboring up to 40,000 parasites.[38] The infected hepatocytes break down, releasing this invasive form of Plasmodium cells, called \"merozoites\" into the bloodstream. In the blood, the merozoites rapidly invade individual red blood cells, replicating over 24–72 hours to form 16–32 new merozoites.[38] The infected red blood cell lyses, and the new merozoites infect new red blood cells, resulting in a cycle that continuously amplifies the number of parasites in an infected person.[38] However, most of the P. vivax replicating merozoite biomass is now (since 2021) known to be hidden in the spleen and bone marrow (perhaps elsewhere too), thereby supporting the astute, long-standing (since 2011) but previously ignored theory that non-circulating merozoites are the source many P. vivax malarial recurrences (see “Recurrent malaria” section below).[39] Over rounds of this red blood cell infection cycle in the bloodstream and elsewhere, a small portion of parasites do not replicate, but instead develop into early sexual stage parasites called male and female \"gametocytes\". These gametocytes develop in the bone marrow for 11 days, then return to the blood circulation to await uptake by the bite of another mosquito.[38] Once inside a mosquito, the gametocytes undergo sexual reproduction, and eventually form daughter sporozoites that migrate to the mosquito\\'s salivary glands to be injected into a new host when the mosquito bites.[38] The liver infection causes no symptoms; all symptoms of malaria result from the infection of red blood cells.[31] Symptoms develop once there are more than around 100,000 parasites per milliliter of blood.[31] Many of the symptoms associated with severe malaria are caused by the tendency of P. falciparum to bind to blood vessel walls, resulting in damage to the affected vessels and surrounding tissue. Parasites sequestered in the blood vessels of the lung contribute to respiratory failure. In the brain, they contribute to coma. In the placenta they contribute to low birthweight and preterm labor, and increase the risk of abortion and stillbirth.[31] The destruction of red blood cells during infection often results in anemia, exacerbated by reduced production of new red blood cells during infection.[31] Only female mosquitoes feed on blood; male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar and do not transmit the disease. Females of the mosquito genus Anopheles prefer to feed at night. They usually start searching for a meal at dusk, and continue through the night until they succeed.[40] Malaria parasites can also be transmitted by blood transfusions, although this is rare.[41] Symptoms of malaria can recur after varying symptom-free periods. Depending upon the cause, recurrence can be classified as recrudescence, relapse, or reinfection. Recrudescence is when symptoms return after a symptom-free period and the origin is parasites that survived in the blood as a result of inadequate or ineffective treatment.[42] Relapse is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from the blood and the recurrence source is activated parasites which had persisted as dormant hypnozoites in liver cells.[43] Relapse commonly occurs after 8–24 weeks and is often seen in P.\\xa0vivax and P.\\xa0ovale infections.[9] However, relapse-like P. vivax recurrences are probably being over-attributed to hypnozoite activation. Some of them might have an extra-vascular or sequestered merozoite origin, making those recurrences recrudescences, not relapses.[44] Newly recognised, non-hypnozoite, possible contributing sources to recurrent peripheral P. vivax parasitemia are erythrocytic forms in the bone marrow and spleen.[45] P.\\xa0vivax malaria cases in temperate areas often involve overwintering by hypnozoites, with relapses beginning the year after the mosquito bite.[46] Reinfection means that the parasites responsible for the past infection were eliminated from the body but a new parasite(s) was introduced. Reinfection cannot readily be distinguished from relapse and recrudescence, although recurrence of infection within two weeks of treatment for the initial malarial manifestations is typically attributed to treatment failure.[47] But doing this is not necessarily correct.[48] People may develop some immunity when exposed to frequent infections.[49] Malaria infection develops via two phases: one that involves the liver (exoerythrocytic phase), and one that involves red blood cells, or erythrocytes (erythrocytic phase). When an infected mosquito pierces a person\\'s skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito\\'s saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 8–30 days.[50] After a potential dormant period in the liver, these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle.[50] The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the cell membrane of the infected host liver cell.[51] Within the red blood cells, the parasites multiply further, again asexually, periodically breaking out of their host cells to invade fresh red blood cells. Several such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells.[50] Some P.\\xa0vivax sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites, but instead, produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months (7–10 months is typical) to several years.[46] After a period of dormancy, they reactivate and produce merozoites. Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in P.\\xa0vivax infections,[46] although their existence in P.\\xa0ovale is uncertain.[52] The parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body\\'s immune system because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the spleen. To avoid this fate, the P.\\xa0falciparum parasite displays adhesive proteins on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen.[53] The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as those in placental malaria.[54] Sequestered red blood cells can breach the blood–brain barrier and cause cerebral malaria.[55] According to a 2005 review, due to the high levels of mortality and morbidity caused by malaria—especially the P.\\xa0falciparum species—it has placed the greatest selective pressure on the human genome in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including sickle cell trait, thalassaemia traits, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and the absence of Duffy antigens on red blood cells.[56][57][58] The impact of sickle cell trait on malaria immunity illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs that have occurred because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes a change in the haemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries; however, when the modified haemoglobin\\xa0S molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to distort into a curved sickle shape. In these strands, the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are homozygous (with two copies of the abnormal haemoglobin beta allele) have sickle-cell anaemia, while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anaemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavour the trait\\'s survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form.[58][59] Liver dysfunction as a result of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease. The syndrome is sometimes called malarial hepatitis.[60] While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death.[60] Due to the non-specific nature of malaria symptoms, diagnosis is typically suspected based on symptoms and travel history, then confirmed with a laboratory test to detect the presence of the parasite in the blood (parasitological test). In areas where malaria is common, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends clinicians suspect malaria in any person who reports having fevers, or who has a current temperature above 37.5\\xa0°C without any other obvious cause.[61] Malaria should be suspected in children with signs of anemia: pale palms or a laboratory test showing hemoglobin levels below 8 grams per deciliter of blood.[61] In areas of the world with little to no malaria, the WHO recommends only testing people with possible exposure to malaria (typically travel to a malaria-endemic area) and unexplained fever.[61] Malaria is usually confirmed by the microscopic examination of blood films or by antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). Microscopy – i.e. examining Giemsa-stained blood with a light microscope – is the gold standard for malaria diagnosis.[31] Microscopists typically examine both a \"thick film\" of blood, allowing them to scan many blood cells in a short time, and a \"thin film\" of blood, allowing them to clearly see individual parasites and identify the infecting Plasmodium species.[31] Under typical field laboratory conditions, a microscopist can detect parasites when there are at least 100 parasites per microliter of blood, which is around the lower range of symptomatic infection.[61] Microscopic diagnosis is relatively resource intensive, requiring trained personnel, specific equipment, electricity, and a consistent supply of microscopy slides and stains.[61] In places where microscopy is unavailable, malaria is diagnosed with RDTs, rapid antigen tests that detect parasite proteins in a fingerstick blood sample.[61] A variety of RDTs are commercially available, targeting the parasite proteins histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2, detects P. falciparum only), lactate dehydrogenase, or aldolase.[61] The HRP2 test is widely used in Africa, where P. falciparum predominates.[31] However, since HRP2 persists in the blood for up to five weeks after an infection is treated, an HRP2 test sometimes cannot distinguish whether someone currently has malaria or previously had it.[61] Additionally, some P. falciparum parasites in the Amazon region lack the HRP2 gene, complicating detection.[61] RDTs are fast and easily deployed to places without full diagnostic laboratories.[61] However they give considerably less information than microscopy, and sometimes vary in quality from producer to producer and lot to lot.[61] Serological tests to detect antibodies against Plasmodium from the blood have been developed, but are not used for malaria diagnosis due to their relatively poor sensitivity and specificity. Highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests have been developed, but are not used clinically due to their relatively high cost, and poor specificity for active infections.[61] Malaria is classified into either \"severe\" or \"uncomplicated\" by the World Health Organization (WHO).[9] It is deemed severe when any of the following criteria are present, otherwise it is considered uncomplicated.[62] Cerebral malaria is defined as a severe P.\\xa0falciparum-malaria presenting with neurological symptoms, including coma (with a Glasgow coma scale less than 11, or a Blantyre coma scale less than 3), or with a coma that lasts longer than 30 minutes after a seizure.[63] Methods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. As of 2022, there is one vaccine for malaria (known as RTS,S) which is licensed for use.[11][10] The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high Anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite eventually disappears from that area, as happened in North America, Europe, and parts of the Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could re-establish if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite\\'s reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.[64] Prevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required are out of reach of many of the world\\'s poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar programme in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.[65] In 2021, the World Health Organization confirmed that China has eliminated malaria.[66] In areas where malaria is common, children under five years old often have anaemia, which is sometimes due to malaria. Giving children with anaemia in these areas preventive antimalarial medication improves red blood cell levels slightly but does not affect the risk of death or need for hospitalisation.[67] Vector control refers to methods used to decrease malaria by reducing the levels of transmission by mosquitoes. For individual protection, the most effective insect repellents are based on DEET or picaridin.[68] However, there is insufficient evidence that mosquito repellents can prevent malaria infection.[69] Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are effective, have been commonly used to prevent malaria, and their use has contributed significantly to the decrease in malaria in the 21st century.[70][71][72] ITNs and IRS may not be sufficient to eliminate the disease, as these interventions depend on how many people use nets, how many gaps in insecticide there are (low coverage areas), if people are not protected when outside of the home, and an increase in mosquitoes that are resistant to insecticides.[70] Modifications to people\\'s houses to prevent mosquito exposure may be an important long term prevention measure.[70] Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people and reduce infection rates and transmission of malaria. Nets are not a perfect barrier and are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to find a way past the net. Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net.[73] Between 2000 and 2008, the use of ITNs saved the lives of an estimated 250,000 infants in Sub-Saharan Africa.[74] About 13% of households in Sub-Saharan countries owned ITNs in 2007[75] and 31% of African households were estimated to own at least one ITN in 2008. In 2000, 1.7\\xa0million (1.8%) African children living in areas of the world where malaria is common were protected by an ITN. That number increased to 20.3\\xa0million (18.5%) African children using ITNs in 2007, leaving 89.6\\xa0million children unprotected[76] and to 68% African children using mosquito nets in 2015.[77] Most nets are impregnated with pyrethroids, a class of insecticides with low toxicity. They are most effective when used from dusk to dawn.[78] It is recommended to hang a large \"bed net\" above the center of a bed and either tuck the edges under the mattress or make sure it is large enough such that it touches the ground.[79] ITNs are beneficial towards pregnancy outcomes in malaria-endemic regions in Africa but more data is needed in Asia and Latin America.[80] In areas of high malaria resistance, piperonyl butoxide (PBO) combined with pyrethroids in mosquito netting is effective in reducing malaria infection rates.[81]  Questions remain concerning the durability of PBO on nets as the impact on mosquito mortality was not sustained after twenty washes in experimental trials.[81] Indoor residual spraying is the spraying of insecticides on the walls inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite.[82] As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin.[83] This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use.[84] One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.[85] Communities using insecticide treated nets, in addition to indoor residual spraying with \\'non-pyrethroid-like\\' insecticides found associated reductions in malaria.[86]  Additionally, the use of \\'pyrethroid-like\\' insecticides in addition to indoor residual spraying did not result in a detectable additional benefit in communities using insecticide treated nets.[86] Housing is a risk factor for malaria and modifying the house as a prevention measure may be a sustainable strategy that does not rely on the effectiveness of insecticides such as pyrethroids.[70][87] The physical environment inside and outside the home that may improve the density of mosquitoes are considerations. Examples of potential modifications include how close the home is to mosquito breeding sites, drainage and water supply near the home, availability of mosquito resting sites (vegetation around the home), the proximity to live stock and domestic animals, and physical improvements or modifications to the design of the home to prevent mosquitoes from entering.[70] People have tried a number of other methods to reduce mosquito bites and slow the spread of malaria. Efforts to decrease mosquito larvae by decreasing the availability of open water where they develop, or by adding substances to decrease their development, are effective in some locations.[88] Electronic mosquito repellent devices, which make very high-frequency sounds that are supposed to keep female mosquitoes away, have no supporting evidence of effectiveness.[89] There is a low certainty evidence that fogging may have an effect on malaria transmission.[90] Larviciding by hand delivery of chemical or microbial insecticides into water bodies containing low larval distribution may reduce malarial transmission.[91] There is insufficient evidence to determine whether larvivorous fish can decrease mosquito density and transmission in the area.[92] There are a number of medications that can help prevent or interrupt malaria in travellers to places where infection is common. Many of these medications are also used in treatment. In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—mefloquine, doxycycline, or the combination of atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone)—are frequently used for prevention.[93] Doxycycline and the atovaquone/proguanil are better tolerated while mefloquine is taken once a week.[93] Areas of the world with chloroquine-sensitive malaria are uncommon.[94] Antimalarial mass drug administration to an entire population at the same time may reduce the risk of contracting malaria in the population, however the effectiveness of mass drug administration may vary depending on the prevalence of malaria in the area.[95] Other factors such as drug administration plus other protective measures such as mosiquito control, the proportion of people treated in the area, and the risk of reinfection with malaria may play a role in the effectiveness of mass drug treatment approaches.[95] The protective effect does not begin immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before they arrive, and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward).[96] The use of preventive drugs is often not practical for those who live in areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually given only to pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs, side effects from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining antimalarial drugs outside of wealthy nations.[97] During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anaemia in the mother.[98] The use of preventive drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.[99] Giving antimalarial drugs to infants through intermittent preventive therapy can reduce the risk of having malaria infection, hospital admission, and anaemia.[100] Mefloquine is more effective than sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in preventing malaria for HIV-negative pregnant women. Cotrimoxazole is effective in preventing malaria infection and reduce the risk of getting anaemia in HIV-positive women.[101] Giving sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for three or more doses as intermittent preventive therapy is superior than two doses for HIV-positive women living in malaria-endemic areas.[102] Prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) may also reduce transmission.[103] Community participation and health education strategies promoting awareness of malaria and the importance of control measures have been successfully used to reduce the incidence of malaria in some areas of the developing world.[104] Recognising the disease in the early stages can prevent it from becoming fatal. Education can also inform people to cover over areas of stagnant, still water, such as water tanks that are ideal breeding grounds for the parasite and mosquito, thus cutting down the risk of the transmission between people. This is generally used in urban areas where there are large centers of population in a confined space and transmission would be most likely in these areas.[105] Intermittent preventive therapy is another intervention that has been used successfully to control malaria in pregnant women and infants,[106] and in preschool children where transmission is seasonal.[107] Malaria is treated with antimalarial medications; the ones used depends on the type and severity of the disease.[108] While medications against fever are commonly used, their effects on outcomes are not clear.[109][110] Providing free antimalarial drugs to households may reduce childhood deaths when used appropriately. Programmes which presumptively treat all causes of fever with antimalarial drugs may lead to overuse of antimalarials and undertreat other causes of fever. Nevertheless, the use of malaria rapid-diagnostic kits can help to reduce over-usage of antimalarials.[111][112] Simple or uncomplicated malaria may be treated with oral medications. Artemisinin drugs are effective and safe in treating uncomplicated malaria.[113] Artemisinin in combination with other antimalarials (known as artemisinin-combination therapy, or ACT) is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria.[74] The most effective treatment for P.\\xa0falciparum infection is the use of ACT, which decreases resistance to any single drug component.[114][115] Artemether-lumefantrine (six-dose regimen) is more effective than the artemether-lumefantrine (four-dose regimen) or other regimens not containing artemisinin derivatives in treating falciparum malaria.[116][117] Another recommended combination is dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine.[118][119][120] Artemisinin-naphthoquine combination therapy showed promising results in treating falciparum malaria.[121] However, more research is needed to establish its efficacy as a reliable treatment.[122] Artesunate plus mefloquine performs better than mefloquine alone in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria in low transmission settings.[123] Atovaquone-proguanil is effective against uncomplicated falciparum with a possible failure rate of 5% to 10%; the addition of artesunate may reduce failure rate.[124] Azithromycin monotherapy or combination therapy has not shown effectiveness in treating plasmodium or vivax malaria.[125] Amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine may achieve less treatment failures when compared to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine alone in uncomplicated falciparum malaria.[126] There is insufficient data on chlorproguanil-dapsone in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria.[127][128] The addition of primaquine with artemisinin-based combination therapy for falciparum malaria reduces its transmission at day 3-4 and day 8 of infection.[129] Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate is better than sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine in controlling treatment failure at day 28. However, the latter is better than the former in reducing gametocytes in blood at day 7.[130] Infection with P.\\xa0vivax, P.\\xa0ovale or P.\\xa0malariae usually does not require hospitalisation. Treatment of P.\\xa0vivax malaria requires both elimination of blood stages (using chloroquine or artemisinin-based combination therapy) and clearance of liver forms with an 8-aminoquinoline agent such as primaquine or tafenoquine.[131][132] The view that 8-aminoquinoline drugs kill parasites in the liver is the conventional one. However, there are reasons to believe that primaquine might, to a currently unknown extent, also inactivate non-circulating, extra-hepatic merozoites (clarity in this regard is expected to be forthcoming soon).[133] To treat malaria during pregnancy, the WHO recommends the use of quinine plus clindamycin early in the pregnancy (1st trimester), and ACT in later stages (2nd and 3rd trimesters).[134][135] There is limited safety data on the antimalarial drugs in pregnancy.[136] Cases of severe and complicated malaria are almost always caused by infection with P. falciparum. The other species usually cause only febrile disease.[137] Severe and complicated malaria cases are medical emergencies since mortality rates are high (10% to 50%).[138] Recommended treatment for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate was superior to quinine in both children and adults.[139][140] In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine in the treatment of cerebral malaria in children.[141] Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.[32] Artemisinin derivatives have the same or better efficacy than quinolones in preventing deaths in severe or complicated malaria.[142] Quinine loading dose helps to shorten the duration of fever and increases parasite clearance from the body.[143] There is no difference in effectiveness when using intrarectal quinine compared to intravenous or intramuscular quinine in treating uncomplicated/complicated falciparum malaria.[144] There is insufficient evidence for intramuscular arteether to treat severe malaria.[145] The provision of rectal artesunate before transfer to hospital may reduce the rate of death for children with severe malaria.[146] In children with malaria and concomitant hypoglycaemia, sublingual administration of glucose appears to result in better increases in blood sugar after 20 minutes when compared to oral administration, based on very limited data.[147] Cerebral malaria is the form of severe and complicated malaria with the worst neurological symptoms.[148] There is insufficient data on whether osmotic agents such as mannitol or urea are effective in treating cerebral malaria.[149] Routine phenobarbitone in cerebral malaria is associated with fewer convulsions but possibly more deaths.[150] There is no evidence that steroids would bring treatment benefits for cerebral malaria.[151] Managing Cerebral Malaria Cerebral malaria usually makes a patient comatose, if the cause of the coma is in doubt, test for other locally prevalent causes of encephalopathy (bacterial, viral or fungal infection) should be carried out. In areas where there is a high prevalence of malaria infection (e.g. tropical region) treatment can start without testing first.[30] To manage the cerebral malaria when confirmed the following can be done: There is insufficient evidence to show that blood transfusion is useful in either reducing deaths for children with severe anaemia or in improving their haematocrit in one month.[153] There is insufficient evidence that iron chelating agents such as deferoxamine and deferiprone improve outcomes of those with malaria falciparum infection.[154] A 2022 clinical trial shows that a monoclonal antibody mAb L9LS offers protection against malaria. It binds the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP-1), essential to disease, and makes it ineffective.[155] Drug resistance poses a growing problem in 21st-century malaria treatment.[156] In the 2000s (decade), malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia.[157][158] Resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from artemisinins. Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs. The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world.[159] Malaria strains found on the Cambodia–Thailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and may, therefore, be untreatable.[160] Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years and the availability of substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype.[161] Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam,[162] and there has been emerging resistance in Laos.[163][164] Resistance to the combination of artemisinin and piperaquine was first detected in 2013 in Cambodia, and by 2019 had spread across Cambodia and into Laos, Thailand and Vietnam (with up to 80 percent of malaria parasites resistant in some regions).[165] There is insufficient evidence in unit packaged antimalarial drugs in preventing treatment failures of malaria infection. However, if supported by training of healthcare providers and patient information, there is improvement in compliance of those receiving treatment.[166] When properly treated, people with malaria can usually expect a complete recovery.[167] However, severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days.[168] In the most severe cases of the disease, fatality rates can reach 20%, even with intensive care and treatment.[9] Over the longer term, developmental impairments have been documented in children who have had episodes of severe malaria.[169] Chronic infection without severe disease can occur in an immune-deficiency syndrome associated with a decreased responsiveness to Salmonella bacteria and the Epstein–Barr virus.[170] During childhood, malaria causes anaemia during a period of rapid brain development, and also direct brain damage resulting from cerebral malaria.[169] Some survivors of cerebral malaria have an increased risk of neurological and cognitive deficits, behavioural disorders, and epilepsy.[171] Malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups.[169] The WHO estimates that in 2021 there were 247 million new cases of malaria resulting in 619,000 deaths.[4] Children under 5 years old are the most affected, accounting for 67% of malaria deaths worldwide in 2019.[173] About 125 million pregnant women are at risk of infection each year; in Sub-Saharan Africa, maternal malaria is associated with up to 200,000 estimated infant deaths yearly.[28] There are about 10,000 malaria cases per year in Western Europe, and 1300–1500 in the United States.[24] The United States eradicated malaria as a major public health concern in 1951,[174] though small outbreaks persist.[175] About 900 people died from the disease in Europe between 1993 and 2003.[68] Both the global incidence of disease and resulting mortality have declined in recent years. According to the WHO and UNICEF, deaths attributable to malaria in 2015 were reduced by 60%[77] from a 2000 estimate of 985,000, largely due to the widespread use of insecticide-treated nets and artemisinin-based combination therapies.[74] Efforts at decreasing the disease in Africa since 2000 have been partially effective, with rates of the disease dropping by an estimated forty percent on the continent.[176] Malaria is presently endemic in a broad band around the equator, in areas of the Americas, many parts of Asia, and much of Africa; in Sub-Saharan Africa, 85–90% of malaria fatalities occur.[177] An estimate for 2009 reported that countries with the highest death rate per 100,000 of population were Ivory Coast (86.15), Angola (56.93) and Burkina Faso (50.66).[178] A 2010 estimate indicated the deadliest countries per population were Burkina Faso, Mozambique and Mali.[179] The Malaria Atlas Project aims to map global levels of malaria, providing a way to determine the global spatial limits of the disease and to assess disease burden.[180][181] This effort led to the publication of a map of P.\\xa0falciparum endemicity in 2010 and an update in 2019.[182][183][184] As of 2021, 84 countries have endemic malaria.[4] The geographic distribution of malaria within large regions is complex, and malaria-afflicted and malaria-free areas are often found close to each other.[185] Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions because of rainfall, consistent high temperatures and high humidity, along with stagnant waters where mosquito larvae readily mature, providing them with the environment they need for continuous breeding.[186] In drier areas, outbreaks of malaria have been predicted with reasonable accuracy by mapping rainfall.[187] Malaria is more common in rural areas than in cities. For example, several cities in the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia are essentially malaria-free, but the disease is prevalent in many rural regions, including along international borders and forest fringes.[188] In contrast, malaria in Africa is present in both rural and urban areas, though the risk is lower in the larger cities.[189] Climate change is likely to affect malaria transmission, but the degree of effect and the areas affected is uncertain.[190] Greater rainfall in certain areas of India, and following an El Niño event is associated with increased mosquito numbers.[191] Since 1900 there has been substantial change in temperature and rainfall over Africa.[192] However, factors that contribute to how rainfall results in water for mosquito breeding are complex, incorporating the extent to which it is absorbed into soil and vegetation for example, or rates of runoff and evaporation.[193] Recent research has provided a more in-depth picture of conditions across Africa, combining a malaria climatic suitability model with a continental-scale model representing real-world hydrological processes.[193] Although the parasite responsible for P.\\xa0falciparum malaria has been in existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of the parasite did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture[194] and the development of human settlements. Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the P.\\xa0falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas.[195] References to the unique periodic fevers of malaria are found throughout history.[196] Hippocrates described periodic fevers, labelling them tertian, quartan, subtertian and quotidian.[197] The Roman Columella associated the disease with insects from swamps.[197] Malaria may have contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire,[198] and was so pervasive in Rome that it was known as the \"Roman fever\".[199] Several regions in ancient Rome were considered at-risk for the disease because of the favourable conditions present for malaria vectors. This included areas such as southern Italy, the island of Sardinia, the Pontine Marshes, the lower regions of coastal Etruria and the city of Rome along the Tiber. The presence of stagnant water in these places was preferred by mosquitoes for breeding grounds. Irrigated gardens, swamp-like grounds, run-off from agriculture, and drainage problems from road construction led to the increase of standing water.[200] The term malaria originates from Mediaeval Italian: mala aria—\"bad air\", a part of miasma theory; the disease was formerly called ague or marsh fever due to its association with swamps and marshland.[201] The term appeared in English at least as early as 1768.[202] Malaria was once common in most of Europe and North America,[203] where it is no longer endemic,[204] though imported cases do occur.[205] Malaria is not referenced in the medical books of the Mayans or Aztecs. Despite this, antibodies against malaria have been detected in some South American mummies, indicating that some malaria strains in the Americas might have a pre-Columbian origin.[206] European settlers and the West Africans they enslaved likely brought malaria to the Americas starting in the 16th century.[207][208] Scientific studies on malaria made their first significant advance in 1880, when Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran—a French army doctor working in the military hospital of Constantine in Algeria—observed parasites inside the red blood cells of infected people for the first time.[209] He, therefore, proposed that malaria is caused by this organism, the first time a protist was identified as causing disease.[210] For this and later discoveries, he was awarded the 1907 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. A year later, Carlos Finlay, a Cuban doctor treating people with yellow fever in Havana, provided strong evidence that mosquitoes were transmitting disease to and from humans.[211] This work followed earlier suggestions by Josiah C. Nott,[212] and work by Sir Patrick Manson, the \"father of tropical medicine\", on the transmission of filariasis.[213] In April 1894, a Scottish physician, Sir Ronald Ross, visited Sir Patrick Manson at his house on Queen Anne Street, London. This visit was the start of four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1897 when Ross, who was working in the Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta, proved the complete life-cycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes.[214] He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds.[214] For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in Egypt, Panama, Greece and Mauritius.[215] The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900. Its recommendations were implemented by William C. Gorgas in the health measures undertaken during construction of the Panama Canal. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.[216] In 1896, Amico Bignami discussed the role of mosquitoes in malaria.[217] In 1898, Bignami, Giovanni Battista Grassi and Giuseppe Bastianelli succeeded in showing experimentally the transmission of malaria in humans, using infected mosquitoes to contract malaria themselves which they presented in November 1898 to the Accademia dei Lincei.[214] The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains quinine. This tree grows on the slopes of the Andes, mainly in Peru. The indigenous peoples of Peru made a tincture of cinchona to control fever. Its effectiveness against malaria was found and the Jesuits introduced the treatment to Europe around 1640; by 1677, it was included in the London Pharmacopoeia as an antimalarial treatment.[218] It was not until 1820 that the active ingredient, quinine, was extracted from the bark, isolated and named by the French chemists Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou.[219][220] Quinine was the predominant malarial medication until the 1920s when other medications began to appear. In the 1940s, chloroquine replaced quinine as the treatment of both uncomplicated and severe malaria until resistance supervened, first in Southeast Asia and South America in the 1950s and then globally in the 1980s.[221] The medicinal value of Artemisia annua has been used by Chinese herbalists in traditional Chinese medicines for 2,000 years. In 1596, Li Shizhen recommended tea made from qinghao specifically to treat malaria symptoms in his \"Compendium of Materia Medica\". Artemisinins, discovered by Chinese scientist Tu Youyou and colleagues in the 1970s from the plant Artemisia annua, became the recommended treatment for P.\\xa0falciparum malaria, administered in severe cases in combination with other antimalarials.[222] Tu says she was influenced by a traditional Chinese herbal medicine source, The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments, written in 340 by Ge Hong.[223] For her work on malaria, Tu Youyou received the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.[224] Plasmodium vivax was used between 1917 and the 1940s for malariotherapy—deliberate injection of malaria parasites to induce a fever to combat certain diseases such as tertiary syphilis. In 1927, the inventor of this technique, Julius Wagner-Jauregg, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries. The technique was dangerous, killing about 15% of patients, so it is no longer in use.[225] The first pesticide used for indoor residual spraying was DDT.[226] Although it was initially used exclusively to combat malaria, its use quickly spread to agriculture. In time, pest control, rather than disease control, came to dominate DDT use, and this large-scale agricultural use led to the evolution of pesticide-resistant mosquitoes in many regions. The DDT resistance shown by Anopheles mosquitoes can be compared to antibiotic resistance shown by bacteria. During the 1960s, awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased, ultimately leading to bans on agricultural applications of DDT in many countries in the 1970s.[84] Before DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or controlled in tropical areas like Brazil and Egypt by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larval stages, for example by applying the highly toxic arsenic compound Paris Green to places with standing water.[227] Malaria vaccines have been another goal of research. The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunising mice with live, radiation-attenuated sporozoites, which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites. Since the 1970s, there has been considerable progress in developing similar vaccination strategies for humans.[228] The first vaccine, called RTS,S, was approved by European regulators in 2015.[229] In total, malaria may have killed 50-60 billion people throughout history, or about half of all humans that have ever lived.[230] Various types of malaria have been called by the names below:[231] Malaria has been successfully eliminated or significantly reduced in certain areas, but not globally. Malaria was once common in the United States, but the US eliminated malaria from most parts of the country in the early 20th century using vector control programs, which combined the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in water management practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings.[232]  The use of the pesticide DDT and other means eliminated malaria from the remaining pockets in southern states of the US the 1950s, as part of the National Malaria Eradication Program.[233]  Most of Europe, North America, Australia, North Africa and the Caribbean, and parts of South America, Asia and Southern Africa have also eliminated malaria.[234] The WHO defines \"elimination\" (or \"malaria-free\") as having no domestic transmission (indigenous cases) for the past three years. They also define \"pre-elimination\" and \"elimination\" stages when a country has fewer than 5 or 1, respectively, cases per 1000 people at risk per year.  In 1955 the WHO launched the Global Malaria Eradication Program (GMEP), which supported substantial reductions in malaria cases in some countries, including India.[235] However, due to vector and parasite resistance and other factors, the feasibility of eradicating malaria with the strategy used at the time and resources available led to waning support for the program.[236] WHO suspended the program in 1969.[235][236]Target 6C of the Millennium Development Goals included reversal of the global increase in malaria incidence by 2015, with specific targets for children under 5 years old.[237]  Since 2000, support for malaria eradication increased, although some actors in the global health community (including voices within the WHO) view malaria eradication as a premature goal and suggest that the establishment of strict deadlines for malaria eradication may be counterproductive as they are likely to be missed.[238] In 2006, the organization Malaria No More set a public goal of eliminating malaria from Africa by 2015, and the organization claimed they planned to dissolve if that goal was accomplished. In 2007, World Malaria Day was established by the 60th session of the World Health Assembly. As of 2018, they are still functioning.[239] As of 2012[update], The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria has distributed 230\\xa0million insecticide-treated nets intended to stop mosquito-borne transmission of malaria.[240] The U.S.-based Clinton Foundation has worked to manage demand and stabilize prices in the artemisinin market.[241] Other efforts, such as the Malaria Atlas Project, focus on analysing climate and weather information required to accurately predict malaria spread based on the availability of habitat of malaria-carrying parasites.[180] The Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) was formed in 2012, \"to provide strategic advice and technical input to WHO on all aspects of malaria control and elimination\".[242]  In November 2013, WHO and the malaria vaccine funders group set a goal to develop vaccines designed to interrupt malaria transmission with malaria eradication\\'s long-term goal.[243] In 2015 the WHO targeted a 90% reduction in malaria deaths by 2030,[244] and Bill Gates said in 2016 that he thought global eradication would be possible by 2040.[245] According to the WHO\\'s World Malaria Report 2015, the global mortality rate for malaria fell by 60% between 2000 and 2015. The WHO targeted a further 90% reduction between 2015 and 2030,[246] with a 40% reduction and eradication in 10 countries by 2020.[247] However, the 2020 goal was missed with a slight increase in cases compared to 2015.[248] Before 2016, the Global Fund against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria had provided 659 million ITN (insecticide treated bed nets), organise support and education to prevents malaria. The challenges are high due to the lack of funds, the fragile health structure and the remote indigenous population that could be hard to reach and educate. Most of indigenous population rely on self-diagnosis, self-treatment, healer, and traditional medicine. The WHO applied for fund to the Gates Foundation which favour the action of malaria eradication in 2007.[249] Six countries, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Armenia, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Sri Lanka managed to have no endemic cases of  malaria for three consecutive years and certified malaria-free by the WHO despite the stagnation of the funding in 2010.[237] The funding is essential to finance the cost of medication and hospitalisation cannot be supported by the poor countries where the disease is widely spread. The goal of eradication has not been met; nevertheless, the decrease rate of the disease is considerable. While 31 out of 92 endemic countries were estimated to be on track with the WHO goals for 2020, 15 countries reported an increase of 40% or more between 2015 and 2020.[248] Between 2000 and 30 June 2021, twelve countries were certified by the WHO as being malaria-free.  Argentina and Algeria were declared free of malaria in 2019.[248][250] El Salvador and China were declared malaria-free in the first half of 2021.[251][252] Regional disparities were evident: Southeast Asia was on track to meet WHO\\'s 2020 goals, while Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean and West Pacific regions were off-track.[248]  The six Greater Mekong Subregion countries aim for elimination of P. falciparum transmitted malaria by 2025 and elimination of all malaria by 2030, having achieved a 97% and 90% reduction of cases respectively since 2000.[248] Ahead of World Malaria Day, 25 April 2021, WHO named 25 countries in which it is working to eliminate malaria by 2025 as part of its E-2025 initiative.[253] A major challenge to malaria elimination is the persistence of malaria in border regions, making international cooperation crucial.[254] One of the targets of Goal 3 of the UN\\'s Sustainable Development Goals is to end the malaria epidemic in all countries by 2030. In 2018, WHO announced that Paraguay was free of malaria, after a national malaria eradication effort that began in 1950.[255] As of 2019, the eradication process is ongoing, but it will be difficult to achieve a world free of malaria with the current approaches and tools. Only one malaria vaccine is licensed for use, and it shows relatively low effectiveness, while several other vaccine candidates in clinical trials[11] aim to provide protection for children in endemic areas and reduce the speed of malaria transmission. Approaches may require investing more in research and greater primary health care.[256] Continuing surveillance will also be important to prevent the return of malaria in countries where the disease has been eliminated.[257] Malaria is not just a disease commonly associated with poverty: some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development.[16][17] Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria\\'s furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a major factor in the slow economic development of the American southern states.[258] A comparison of average per capita GDP in 1995, adjusted for parity of purchasing power, between countries with malaria and countries without malaria gives a fivefold difference (US$1,526 versus US$8,268). In the period 1965 to 1990, countries where malaria was common had an average per capita GDP that increased only 0.4% per year, compared to 2.4% per year in other countries.[259] Poverty can increase the risk of malaria since those in poverty do not have the financial capacities to prevent or treat the disease. In its entirety, the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa US$12\\xa0billion every year. The economic impact includes costs of health care, working days lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism.[18] The disease has a heavy burden in some countries, where it may be responsible for 30–50% of hospital admissions, up to 50% of outpatient visits, and up to 40% of public health spending.[260] Cerebral malaria is one of the leading causes of neurological disabilities in African children.[171] Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery.[169] Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching socioeconomic consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.[261] Sophisticated counterfeits have been found in several Asian countries such as Cambodia,[262] China,[263] Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, and are a major cause of avoidable death in those countries.[264] The WHO said that studies indicate that up to 40% of artesunate-based malaria medications are counterfeit, especially in the Greater Mekong region. They have established a rapid alert system to rapidly report information about counterfeit drugs to relevant authorities in participating countries.[265] There is no reliable way for doctors or lay people to detect counterfeit drugs without help from a laboratory. Companies are attempting to combat the persistence of counterfeit drugs by using new technology to provide security from source to distribution.[266] Another clinical and public health concern is the proliferation of substandard antimalarial medicines resulting from inappropriate concentration of ingredients, contamination with other drugs or toxic impurities, poor quality ingredients, poor stability and inadequate packaging.[267] A 2012 study demonstrated that roughly one-third of antimalarial medications in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa failed chemical analysis, packaging analysis, or were falsified.[268] Throughout history, the contraction of malaria has played a prominent role in the fates of government rulers, nation-states, military personnel, and military actions.[269] In 1910, Nobel Prize in Medicine-winner Ronald Ross (himself a malaria survivor), published a book titled The Prevention of Malaria that included a chapter titled \"The Prevention of Malaria in War\". The chapter\\'s author, Colonel C. H. Melville, Professor of Hygiene at Royal Army Medical College in London, addressed the prominent role that malaria has historically played during wars: \"The history of malaria in war might almost be taken to be the history of war itself, certainly the history of war in the Christian era.\\xa0... It is probably the case that many of the so-called camp fevers, and probably also a considerable proportion of the camp dysentery, of the wars of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were malarial in origin.\"[270] In British-occupied India the cocktail gin and tonic may have come about as a way of taking quinine, known for its antimalarial properties.[271] Malaria was the most significant health hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during World War II, where about 500,000 men were infected.[272] According to Joseph Patrick Byrne, \"Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the African and South Pacific campaigns.\"[273] Significant financial investments have been made to procure existing and create new antimalarial agents. During World War I and World War II, inconsistent supplies of the natural antimalaria drugs cinchona bark and quinine prompted substantial funding into research and development of other drugs and vaccines. American military organisations conducting such research initiatives include the Navy Medical Research Center, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases of the US Armed Forces.[274] Additionally, initiatives have been founded such as Malaria Control in War Areas (MCWA), established in 1942, and its successor, the Communicable Disease Center (now known as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC) established in 1946. According to the CDC, MCWA \"was established to control malaria around military training bases in the southern United States and its territories, where malaria was still problematic\".[275] The Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) initiative was a consultative process to identify which areas of research and development (R&D) must be addressed for worldwide eradication of malaria.[276][277] A vaccine against malaria called RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) was approved by European regulators in 2015.[229] As of 2019 it is undergoing pilot trials in 3 sub-Saharan African countries – Ghana, Kenya and Malawi – as part of the WHO\\'s Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP).[278] Immunity (or, more accurately, tolerance) to P.\\xa0falciparum malaria does occur naturally, but only in response to years of repeated infection.[49][279] An individual can be protected from a P.\\xa0falciparum infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry a version of the parasite rendered non-infective by a dose of X-ray irradiation.[280] The highly polymorphic nature of many P.\\xa0falciparum proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design. Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito.[281] Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite\\'s life cycle, have been inadequate on their own.[282] For example, SPf66 was tested extensively in areas where the disease was common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.[283] In 2021, researchers from the University of Oxford reported findings from a Phase IIb trial of a candidate malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M, which demonstrated efficacy of 77% over 12-months of follow-up. This vaccine is the first to meet the World Health Organization\\'s Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap goal of a vaccine with at least 75% efficacy.[284] Malaria parasites contain apicoplasts, organelles related to the plastids found in plants, complete with their own genomes. These apicoplasts are thought to have originated through the endosymbiosis of algae and play a crucial role in various aspects of parasite metabolism, such as fatty acid biosynthesis. Over 400 proteins have been found to be produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel antimalarial drugs.[285] With the onset of drug-resistant Plasmodium parasites, new strategies are being developed to combat the widespread disease. One such approach lies in the introduction of synthetic pyridoxal-amino acid adducts, which are taken up by the parasite and ultimately interfere with its ability to create several essential B vitamins.[286][287] Antimalarial drugs using synthetic metal-based complexes are attracting research interest.[288][289] On the basis of molecular docking outcomes, compounds 3j, 4b, 4h, 4m were exhibited selectivity towards PfLDH. The post docking analysis displayed stable dynamic behavior of all the selected compounds compared to Chloroquine. The end state thermodynamics analysis stated 3j compound as a selective and potent PfLDH inhibitor.[291] Targeting Plasmodium liver-stage parasites selectively is emerging as an alternative strategy in the face of resistance to the latest frontline combination therapies against blood stages of the parasite.[292] In a research conducted in 2019, using experimental analysis with knockout (KO) mutants of Plasmodium berguei the authors were able to identify genes that are potentially essential in the liver stage. Moreover, they generated a computational model to analyse pre–erytrocytic development and liver–stage metabolism. Combining both methods they identified seven metabolic subsystems that become essential compared to the blood stage. Some of these metabolic pathways are fatty acid synthesis and elongation, tricarboxylic acid, amino acid and heme metabolism among others.[292] Specifically, they studied 3 subsystems: fatty acid synthesis and elongation, and amino sugar biosynthesis. For the first two pathways they demonstrated a clear dependence of the liver stage on its own fatty acid metabolism.[292] They proved for the first time the critical role of amino sugar biosynthesis in the liver stage of P. berghei. The uptake of N–acetyl–glucosamine appears to be limited in the liver stage, being its synthesis needed for the parasite development.[292] These findings and the computational model provide a basis for the design of antimalarial therapies targeting metabolic proteins.[292][293] A non-chemical vector control strategy involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in genetic engineering technologies make it possible to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.[73] Genomics is central to malaria research. With the sequencing of P.\\xa0falciparum, one of its vectors Anopheles gambiae, and the human genome, the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria life cycle can be studied.[294] Another new application of genetic technology is the ability to produce genetically modified mosquitoes that do not transmit malaria, potentially allowing biological control of malaria transmission.[295] In one study, a genetically modified strain of Anopheles stephensi was created that no longer supported malaria transmission, and this resistance was passed down to mosquito offspring.[296] Gene drive is a technique for changing wild populations, for instance to combat or eliminate insects so they cannot transmit diseases (in particular mosquitoes in the cases of malaria,[297] zika,[298] dengue and yellow fever).[244] In December 2020, a review article found that malaria-endemic regions had lower reported COVID-19 case fatality rates on average than regions where malaria was not known to be endemic.[299] Additionally, research conducted in 2015 demonstrated that in mice, malaria co-infection with the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, a pulmonary migrating helminth, has dampened the virulence of the Plasmodium parasite.[300] Researchers demonstrated bottom-up control of malaria infection by the nematode; specifically, nematode infection leads to increased destruction of erythrocytes. It is known that Plasmodium prefers older host erythrocytes, which are easier for it to infect, so increased destruction, causing subsequent increased erythropoiesis, leads to an overall younger erythrocyte population resulting in a decrease in Plasmodium population.[300] Interestingly, this disease control is largely independent of host immune control of Plasmodium, and may provide interesting insights for future treatment.[300] While there are no animal reservoirs for the strains of malaria that cause human infections,[301] nearly 200 parasitic Plasmodium species have been identified that infect birds, reptiles, and other mammals,[302] and about 30 species naturally infect non-human primates.[303] Some malaria parasites that affect non-human primates (NHP) serve as model organisms for human malarial parasites, such as P.\\xa0coatneyi (a model for P.\\xa0falciparum) and P.\\xa0cynomolgi (P.\\xa0vivax). Diagnostic techniques used to detect parasites in NHP are similar to those employed for humans.[304] Malaria parasites that infect rodents are widely used as models in research, such as P.\\xa0berghei.[305] Avian malaria primarily affects species of the order Passeriformes, and poses a substantial threat to birds of Hawaii, the Galapagos, and other archipelagoes. The parasite P.\\xa0relictum is known to play a role in limiting the distribution and abundance of endemic Hawaiian birds. Global warming is expected to increase the prevalence and global distribution of avian malaria, as elevated temperatures provide optimal conditions for parasite reproduction.[306]   Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria.[1] Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body.[1] Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis.[1] Around 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kill about half of those affected.[1] Typical symptoms of active TB are chronic cough with blood-containing mucus, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.[1] It was historically referred to as consumption due to the weight loss associated with the disease.[8] Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.[9] Tuberculosis is spread from one person to the next through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze.[1][10] People with Latent TB do not spread the disease.[1] Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke.[1] Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids.[11] Diagnosis of Latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.[11] Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine.[3][4][5] Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB.[4] Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time.[1] Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem, with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).[1] In 2018, one quarter of the world\\'s population was thought to have a latent infection of TB.[6] New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year.[12] In 2020, an estimated 10\\xa0million people developed active TB, resulting in 1.5\\xa0million deaths, making it the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease after COVID-19.[13] As of 2018, most TB cases occurred in the regions of South-East Asia (44%), Africa (24%), and the Western Pacific (18%), with more than 50% of cases being diagnosed in seven countries: India (27%), China (9%), Indonesia (8%), the Philippines (6%), Pakistan (6%), Nigeria (4%), and Bangladesh (4%).[14] By 2021, the number of new cases each year was decreasing by around 2% annually.[13][1] About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive, while 5–10% of people in the United States test positive via the tuberculin test.[15] Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times.[16] Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[9] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[9] General signs and symptoms include fever, chills, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fatigue.[9] Significant nail clubbing may also occur.[18] If a tuberculosis infection does become active, it most commonly involves the lungs (in about 90% of cases).[16][19] Symptoms may include chest pain and a prolonged cough producing sputum. About 25% of people may not have any symptoms (i.e., they remain asymptomatic).[16] Occasionally, people may cough up blood in small amounts, and in very rare cases, the infection may erode into the pulmonary artery or a Rasmussen\\'s aneurysm, resulting in massive bleeding.[9][20] Tuberculosis may become a chronic illness and cause extensive scarring in the upper lobes of the lungs. The upper lung lobes are more frequently affected by tuberculosis than the lower ones.[9] The reason for this difference is not clear.[15] It may be due to either better air flow,[15] or poor lymph drainage within the upper lungs.[9] In 15–20% of active cases, the infection spreads outside the lungs, causing other kinds of TB.[21] These are collectively denoted as extrapulmonary tuberculosis.[22] Extrapulmonary TB occurs more commonly in people with a weakened immune system and young children. In those with HIV, this occurs in more than 50% of cases.[22] Notable extrapulmonary infection sites include the pleura (in tuberculous pleurisy), the central nervous system (in tuberculous meningitis), the lymphatic system (in scrofula of the neck), the genitourinary system (in urogenital tuberculosis), and the bones and joints (in Pott disease of the spine), among others. A potentially more serious, widespread form of TB is called \"disseminated tuberculosis\", it is also known as miliary tuberculosis.[9] Miliary TB currently makes up about 10% of extrapulmonary cases.[23] The main cause of TB is Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), a small, aerobic, nonmotile bacillus.[9] The high lipid content of this pathogen accounts for many of its unique clinical characteristics.[24] It divides every 16 to 20 hours, which is an extremely slow rate compared with other bacteria, which usually divide in less than an hour.[25] Mycobacteria have an outer membrane lipid bilayer.[26] If a Gram stain is performed, MTB either stains very weakly \"Gram-positive\" or does not retain dye as a result of the high lipid and mycolic acid content of its cell wall.[27] MTB can withstand weak disinfectants and survive in a dry state for weeks. In nature, the bacterium can grow only within the cells of a host organism, but M. tuberculosis can be cultured in the laboratory.[28] Using histological stains on expectorated samples from phlegm (also called sputum), scientists can identify MTB under a microscope. Since MTB retains certain stains even after being treated with acidic solution, it is classified as an acid-fast bacillus.[15][27] The most common acid-fast staining techniques are the Ziehl–Neelsen stain[29] and the Kinyoun stain, which dye acid-fast bacilli a bright red that stands out against a blue background.[30] Auramine-rhodamine staining[31] and fluorescence microscopy[32] are also used. The M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) includes four other TB-causing mycobacteria: M. bovis, M. africanum, M. canetti, and M. microti.[33] M. africanum is not widespread, but it is a significant cause of tuberculosis in parts of Africa.[34][35] M. bovis was once a common cause of tuberculosis, but the introduction of pasteurized milk has almost eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries.[15][36] M. canetti is rare and seems to be limited to the Horn of Africa, although a few cases have been seen in African emigrants.[37][38] M. microti is also rare and is seen almost only in immunodeficient people, although its prevalence may be significantly underestimated.[39]  Other known pathogenic mycobacteria include M. leprae, M. avium, and M. kansasii. The latter two species are classified as \"nontuberculous mycobacteria\" (NTM) or atypical mycobacteria. NTM cause neither TB nor leprosy, but they do cause lung diseases that resemble TB.[40]When people with active pulmonary TB cough, sneeze, speak, sing, or spit, they expel infectious aerosol droplets 0.5 to 5.0 µm in diameter. A single sneeze can release up to 40,000 droplets.[41] Each one of these droplets may transmit the disease, since the infectious dose of tuberculosis is very small (the inhalation of fewer than 10 bacteria may cause an infection).[42] People with prolonged, frequent, or close contact with people with TB are at particularly high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate.[43] A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year.[44] Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious.[15] The probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others.[45] The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active (\"overt\") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others.[43] If someone does become infected, it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others.[46] A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[47] The most important risk factor globally for developing active TB is concurrent HIV infection; 13% of those with TB are also infected with HIV.[48] This is a particular problem in sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV infection rates are high.[49][50] Of those without HIV infection who are infected with tuberculosis, about 5–10% develop active disease during their lifetimes;[18] in contrast, 30% of those co-infected with HIV develop the active disease.[18] Use of certain medications, such as corticosteroids and infliximab (an anti-αTNF monoclonal antibody), is another important risk factor, especially in the developed world.[16] Other risk factors include: alcoholism,[16] diabetes mellitus (3-fold increased risk),[51] silicosis (30-fold increased risk),[52] tobacco smoking (2-fold increased risk),[53] indoor air pollution, malnutrition, young age,[47] recently acquired TB infection, recreational drug use, severe kidney disease, low body weight, organ transplant, head and neck cancer,[54] and genetic susceptibility[55] (the overall importance of genetic risk factors remains undefined[16]). Tobacco smoking increases the risk of infections (in addition to increasing the risk of active disease and death). Additional factors increasing infection susceptibility include young age.[47] About 90% of those infected with M. tuberculosis have asymptomatic, latent TB infections (sometimes called LTBI),[57] with only a 10% lifetime chance that the latent infection will progress to overt, active tuberculous disease.[58] In those with HIV, the risk of developing active TB increases to nearly 10% a year.[58] If effective treatment is not given, the death rate for active TB cases is up to 66%.[44] TB infection begins when the mycobacteria reach the alveolar air sacs of the lungs, where they invade and replicate within endosomes of alveolar macrophages.[15][59][60] Macrophages identify the bacterium as foreign and attempt to eliminate it by phagocytosis. During this process, the bacterium is enveloped by the macrophage and stored temporarily in a membrane-bound vesicle called a phagosome. The phagosome then combines with a lysosome to create a phagolysosome. In the phagolysosome, the cell attempts to use reactive oxygen species and acid to kill the bacterium.  However, M. tuberculosis has a thick, waxy mycolic acid capsule that protects it from these toxic substances. M. tuberculosis is able to reproduce inside the macrophage and will eventually kill the immune cell. The primary site of infection in the lungs, known as the Ghon focus, is generally located in either the upper part of the lower lobe, or the lower part of the upper lobe.[15] Tuberculosis of the lungs may also occur via infection from the blood stream. This is known as a Simon focus and is typically found in the top of the lung.[61] This hematogenous transmission can also spread infection to more distant sites, such as peripheral lymph nodes, the kidneys, the brain, and the bones.[15][62] All parts of the body can be affected by the disease, though for unknown reasons it rarely affects the heart, skeletal muscles, pancreas, or thyroid.[63] Tuberculosis is classified as one of the granulomatous inflammatory diseases. Macrophages, epithelioid cells, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and fibroblasts  aggregate to form granulomas, with lymphocytes surrounding the infected macrophages. When other macrophages attack the infected macrophage, they fuse together to form a giant multinucleated cell in the alveolar lumen. The granuloma may prevent dissemination of the mycobacteria and provide a local environment for interaction of cells of the immune system.[64] However, more recent evidence suggests that the bacteria use the granulomas to avoid destruction by the host\\'s immune system.  Macrophages and dendritic cells in the granulomas are unable to present antigen to lymphocytes; thus the immune response is suppressed.[65] Bacteria inside the granuloma can become dormant, resulting in latent infection. Another feature of the granulomas is the development of abnormal cell death (necrosis) in the center of tubercles.  To the naked eye, this has the texture of soft, white cheese and is termed caseous necrosis.[64] If TB bacteria gain entry to the blood stream from an area of damaged tissue, they can spread throughout the body and set up many foci of infection, all appearing as tiny, white tubercles in the tissues.[66] This severe form of TB disease, most common in young children and those with HIV, is called miliary tuberculosis.[67] People with this disseminated TB have a high fatality rate even with treatment (about 30%).[23][68] In many people, the infection waxes and wanes. Tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by healing and fibrosis.[64] Affected tissue is replaced by scarring and cavities filled with caseous necrotic material. During active disease, some of these cavities are joined to the air passages (bronchi) and this material can be coughed up. It contains living bacteria and thus can spread the infection. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place. Upon cure, affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue.[64] Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[69] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[70] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[70] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[70] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[71][72] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[72][73] A definitive diagnosis of TB is made by identifying M. tuberculosis in a clinical sample (e.g., sputum, pus, or a tissue biopsy). However, the difficult culture process for this slow-growing organism can take two to six weeks for blood or sputum culture.[74] Thus, treatment is often begun before cultures are confirmed.[75] Nucleic acid amplification tests and adenosine deaminase testing may allow rapid diagnosis of TB.[69] Blood tests to detect antibodies are not specific or sensitive, so they are not recommended.[76] The Mantoux tuberculin skin test is often used to screen people at high risk for TB.[70] Those who have been previously immunized with the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine may have a false-positive test result.[77] The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis.[15] Interferon gamma release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test.[75] These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results.[78] However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii.[79] IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone.[80] The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended screening people who are at high risk for latent tuberculosis with either tuberculin skin tests or interferon-gamma release assays.[81] While some have recommend testing health care workers, evidence of benefit for this is poor as of 2019[update].[82] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stopped recommending yearly testing of health care workers without known exposure in 2019.[83] Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[16] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[16] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[84] The only available vaccine as of 2021[update] is bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG).[85][86] In children it decreases the risk of getting the infection by 20% and the risk of infection turning into active disease by nearly 60%.[87] It is the most widely used vaccine worldwide, with more than 90% of all children being vaccinated.[16] The immunity it induces decreases after about ten years.[16] As tuberculosis is uncommon in most of Canada, Western Europe, and the United States, BCG is administered to only those people at high risk.[88][89][90] Part of the reasoning against the use of the vaccine is that it makes the tuberculin skin test falsely positive, reducing the test\\'s usefulness as a screening tool.[90] Several vaccines are being developed.[16] Intradermal MVA85A vaccine in addition to BCG injection is not effective in preventing tuberculosis.[91] Public health campaigns which have focused on overcrowding, public spitting and regular sanitation (including hand washing) during the 1800s helped to either interrupt or slow spread which when combined with contact tracing, isolation and treatment helped to dramatically curb the transmission of both tuberculosis and other airborne diseases which led to the elimination of tuberculosis as a major public health issue in most developed economies.[92][93] Other risk factors which worsened TB spread such as malnutrition were also ameliorated, but since the emergence of HIV a new population of immunocompromised individuals was available for TB to infect. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared TB a \"global health emergency\" in 1993,[16] and in 2006, the Stop TB Partnership developed a Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis that aimed to save 14\\xa0million lives between its launch and 2015.[94] A number of targets they set were not achieved by 2015, mostly due to the increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis and the emergence of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis.[16] A tuberculosis classification system developed by the American Thoracic Society is used primarily in public health programs.[95] In 2015, it launched the End TB Strategy to reduce deaths by 95% and incidence by 90% before 2035. The goal of tuberculosis elimination is hampered by the lack of rapid testing, of short and effective treatment courses, and of completely effective vaccines.[96] The benefits and risks of giving anti-tubercular drugs in those exposed to MDR-TB is unclear.[97] Making HAART therapy available to HIV-positive individuals significantly reduces the risk of progression to an active TB infection by up to 90% and can mitigate the spread through this population.[98] Treatment of TB uses antibiotics to kill the bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective.[99] Active TB is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics to reduce the risk of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance.[16] The routine use of rifabutin instead of rifampicin in HIV-positive people with tuberculosis is of unclear benefit as of 2007[update].[100] Latent TB is treated with either isoniazid or rifampin alone, or a combination of isoniazid with either rifampicin or rifapentine.[101][102][103] The treatment takes three to nine months depending on the medications used.[45][101][104][103] People with latent infections are treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life.[105] Education or counselling may improve the latent tuberculosis treatment completion rates.[106] The recommended treatment of new-onset pulmonary tuberculosis, as of 2010[update], is six months of a combination of antibiotics containing rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the first two months, and only rifampicin and isoniazid for the last four months.[16] Where resistance to isoniazid is high, ethambutol may be added for the last four months as an alternative.[16] Treatment with anti-TB drugs for at least 6 months results in higher success rates when compared with treatment less than 6 months, even though the difference is small. Shorter treatment regimen may be recommended for those with compliance issues.[107] There is also no evidence to support shorter anti-tuberculosis treatment regimens when compared to a 6-month treatment regimen.[108] However recently, results from an international, randomized, controlled clinical trial indicate that a four-month daily treatment regimen containing high-dose, or \"optimized\", rifapentine with moxifloxacin (2PHZM/2PHM) is as safe and effective as the existing standard six-month daily regimen at curing drug-susceptible tuberculosis (TB) disease.[109] If tuberculosis recurs, testing to determine which antibiotics it is sensitive to is important before determining treatment.[16] If multiple drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is detected, treatment with at least four effective antibiotics for 18 to 24\\xa0months is recommended.[16] Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics.[110] The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is of poor quality.[111] There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves the number of people who were cured or the number of people who complete their medicine.[111] Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is also no difference if people are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker.[111] Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment and appointments may result in a small but important improvement.[112] There is also not enough evidence to support intermittent rifampicin-containing therapy given two to three times a week has equal effectiveness as daily dose regimen on improving cure rates and reducing relapsing rates.[113] There is also not enough evidence on effectiveness of giving intermittent twice or thrice weekly short course regimen compared to daily dosing regimen in treating children with tuberculosis.[114] Primary resistance occurs when a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication.[115] Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second-line drugs.[116] Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs.[117] It was first observed in 2003 in Italy,[118] but not widely reported until 2012,[117][119] and has also been found in Iran and India.[120] There is some efficacy for linezolid to treat those with XDR-TB but side effects and discontinuation of medications were common.[121][122] Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.[123] XDR-TB is a term sometimes used to define extensively resistant TB, and constitutes one in ten cases of MDR-TB. Cases of XDR TB have been identified in more than 90% of countries.[120] For those with known rifampicin or MDR-TB, molecular tests such as the Genotype MTBDRsl Assay (performed on culture isolates or smear positive specimens) may be useful to detect second-line anti-tubercular drug resistance.[124][125] Progression from TB infection to overt TB disease occurs when the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection.[15] However, in the majority of cases, a latent infection occurs with no obvious symptoms.[15] These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.[18] The risk of reactivation increases with immunosuppression, such as that caused by infection with HIV. In people coinfected with M. tuberculosis and HIV, the risk of reactivation increases to 10% per year.[15] Studies using DNA fingerprinting of M. tuberculosis strains have shown reinfection contributes more substantially to recurrent TB than previously thought,[127] with estimates that it might account for more than 50% of reactivated cases in areas where TB is common.[128] The chance of death from a case of tuberculosis is about 4% as of 2008[update], down from 8% in 1995.[16] In people with smear-positive pulmonary TB (without HIV co-infection), after 5 years without treatment, 50-60% die while 20-25% achieve spontaneous resolution (cure). TB is almost always fatal in those with untreated HIV co-infection and death rates are increased even with antiretroviral treatment of HIV.[129] Roughly one-quarter of the world\\'s population has been infected with M. tuberculosis,[6] with new infections occurring in about 1% of the population each year.[12] However, most infections with M. tuberculosis do not cause disease,[130] and 90–95% of infections remain asymptomatic.[57] In 2012, an estimated 8.6\\xa0million chronic cases were active.[131] In 2010, 8.8\\xa0million new cases of tuberculosis were diagnosed, and 1.20–1.45\\xa0million deaths occurred (most of these occurring in developing countries).[48][132] Of these, about 0.35\\xa0million occur in those also infected with HIV.[133] In 2018, tuberculosis was the leading cause of death worldwide from a single infectious agent.[134] The total number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2005, while new cases have decreased since 2002.[48] Tuberculosis[clarification needed] incidence is seasonal, with peaks occurring every spring and summer.[135][136][137][138] The reasons for this are unclear, but may be related to vitamin D deficiency during the winter.[138][139] There are also studies linking tuberculosis to different weather conditions like low temperature, low humidity and low rainfall. It has been suggested that tuberculosis incidence rates may be connected to climate change.[140] Tuberculosis is closely linked to both overcrowding and malnutrition, making it one of the principal diseases of poverty.[16] Those at high risk thus include: people who inject illicit drugs, inhabitants and employees of locales where vulnerable people gather (e.g., prisons and homeless shelters), medically underprivileged and resource-poor communities, high-risk ethnic minorities, children in close contact with high-risk category patients, and health-care providers serving these patients.[141] The rate of tuberculosis varies with age. In Africa, it primarily affects adolescents and young adults.[142] However, in countries where incidence rates have declined dramatically (such as the United States), tuberculosis is mainly a disease of the elderly and immunocompromised (risk factors are listed above).[15][143] Worldwide, 22 \"high-burden\" states or countries together experience 80% of cases as well as 83% of deaths.[120] In Canada and Australia, tuberculosis is many times more common among the Indigenous peoples, especially in remote areas.[144][145] Factors contributing to this include higher prevalence of predisposing health conditions and behaviours, and overcrowding and poverty. In some Canadian Indigenous groups, genetic susceptibility may play a role.[47] Socioeconomic status (SES) strongly affects TB risk. People of low SES are both more likely to contract TB and to be more severely affected by the disease. Those with low SES are more likely to be affected by risk factors for developing TB (e.g., malnutrition, indoor air pollution, HIV co-infection, etc.), and are additionally more likely to be exposed to crowded and poorly ventilated spaces. Inadequate healthcare also means that people with active disease who facilitate spread are not diagnosed and treated promptly; sick people thus remain in the infectious state and (continue to) spread the infection.[47] The distribution of tuberculosis is not uniform across the globe; about 80% of the population in many African, Caribbean, South Asian, and eastern European countries test positive in tuberculin tests, while only 5–10% of the U.S. population test positive.[15] Hopes of totally controlling the disease have been dramatically dampened because of many factors, including the difficulty of developing an effective vaccine, the expensive and time-consuming diagnostic process, the necessity of many months of treatment, the increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis, and the emergence of drug-resistant cases in the 1980s.[16] In developed countries, tuberculosis is less common and is found mainly in urban areas. In Europe, deaths from TB fell from 500 out of 100,000 in 1850 to 50 out of 100,000 by 1950. Improvements in public health were reducing tuberculosis even before the arrival of antibiotics, although the disease remained a significant threat to public health, such that when the Medical Research Council was formed in Britain in 1913 its initial focus was tuberculosis research.[146] In 2010, rates per 100,000 people in different areas of the world were: globally 178, Africa 332, the Americas 36, Eastern Mediterranean 173, Europe 63, Southeast Asia 278, and Western Pacific 139.[133] Russia has achieved particularly dramatic progress with a decline in its TB mortality rate—from 61.9 per 100,000 in 1965 to 2.7 per 100,000 in 1993;[147][148] however, mortality rate increased to 24 per 100,000 in 2005 and then recoiled to 11 per 100,000 by 2015.[149] China has achieved particularly dramatic progress, with about an 80% reduction in its TB mortality rate between 1990 and 2010.[133] The number of new cases has declined by 17% between 2004 and 2014.[120] In 2007, the country with the highest estimated incidence rate of TB was Eswatini, with 1,200 cases per 100,000 people. In 2017, the country with the highest estimated incidence rate as a\\xa0% of the population was Lesotho, with 665 cases per 100,000 people.[150] As of 2017, India had the largest total incidence, with an estimated 2,740,000 cases.[150] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2000–2015, India\\'s estimated mortality rate dropped from 55 to 36 per 100,000 population per year with estimated 480 thousand people died of TB in 2015.[151][152] In India a major proportion of tuberculosis patients are being treated by private partners and private hospitals. Evidence indicates that the tuberculosis national survey does not represent the number of cases that are diagnosed and recorded by private clinics and hospitals in India.[153] In the United States, Native Americans have a fivefold greater mortality from TB,[154] and racial and ethnic minorities accounted for 84% of all reported TB cases.[155] In the United States, the overall tuberculosis case rate was 3 per 100,000 persons in 2017.[150] In Canada, tuberculosis is still endemic in some rural areas.[156] In 2017, in the United Kingdom, the national average was 9 per 100,000 and the highest incidence rates in Western Europe were 20 per 100,000 in Portugal. Number of new cases of tuberculosis per 100,000 people in 2016[157] Tuberculosis deaths per million persons in 2012 Tuberculosis deaths by region, 1990 to 2017[158] Tuberculosis has existed since antiquity.[16] The oldest unambiguously detected M. tuberculosis gives evidence of the disease in the remains of bison in Wyoming dated to around 17,000 years ago.[159] However, whether tuberculosis originated in bovines, then transferred to humans, or whether both bovine and human tuberculosis diverged from a common ancestor, remains unclear.[160] A comparison of the genes of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in humans to MTBC in animals suggests humans did not acquire MTBC from animals during animal domestication, as researchers previously believed. Both strains of the tuberculosis bacteria share a common ancestor, which could have infected humans even before the Neolithic Revolution.[161] Skeletal remains show some prehistoric humans (4000 BC) had TB, and researchers have found tubercular decay in the spines of Egyptian mummies dating from 3000 to 2400 BC.[162] Genetic studies suggest the presence of TB in the Americas from about AD 100.[163] Before the Industrial Revolution, folklore often associated tuberculosis with vampires. When one member of a family died from the disease, the other infected members would lose their health slowly. People believed this was caused by the original person with TB draining the life from the other family members.[164] Although Richard Morton established the pulmonary form associated with tubercles as a pathology in 1689,[165][166] due to the variety of its symptoms, TB was not identified as a single disease until the 1820s.  Benjamin Marten conjectured in 1720 that consumptions were caused by microbes which were spread by people living close to each other.[167] In 1819, René Laennec claimed that tubercles were the cause of pulmonary tuberculosis.[168] J. L. Schönlein first published the name \"tuberculosis\" (German:  Tuberkulose) in 1832.[169][170] Between 1838 and 1845, John Croghan, the owner of Mammoth Cave in Kentucky from 1839 onwards, brought a number of people with tuberculosis into the cave in the hope of curing the disease with the constant temperature and purity of the cave air; each died within a year.[171] Hermann Brehmer opened the first TB sanatorium in 1859 in Görbersdorf (now Sokołowsko) in Silesia.[172] In 1865, Jean Antoine Villemin demonstrated that tuberculosis could be transmitted, via inoculation, from humans to animals and among animals.[173] (Villemin\\'s findings were confirmed in 1867 and 1868 by John Burdon-Sanderson.[174]) Robert Koch identified and described the bacillus causing tuberculosis, M. tuberculosis, on 24 March 1882.[175][176] In 1905, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this discovery.[177] Koch did not believe the cattle and human tuberculosis diseases were similar, which delayed the recognition of infected milk as a source of infection. During the first half of the 1900s, the risk of transmission from this source was dramatically reduced after the application of the pasteurization process. Koch announced a glycerine extract of the tubercle bacilli as a \"remedy\" for tuberculosis in 1890, calling it \"tuberculin\". Although it was not effective, it was later successfully adapted as a screening test for the presence of pre-symptomatic tuberculosis.[178] World Tuberculosis Day is marked on 24 March each year, the anniversary of Koch\\'s original scientific announcement. Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin achieved the first genuine success in immunization against tuberculosis in 1906, using attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis. It was called bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG). The BCG vaccine was first used on humans in 1921 in France,[179] but achieved widespread acceptance in the US, Great Britain, and Germany only after World War II.[180] Tuberculosis caused widespread public concern in the 19th and early 20th centuries as the disease became common among the urban poor. In 1815, one in four deaths in England was due to \"consumption\". By 1918, TB still caused one in six deaths in France.[citation needed] After TB was determined to be contagious, in the 1880s, it was put on a notifiable-disease list in Britain; campaigns started to stop people from spitting in public places, and the infected poor were \"encouraged\" to enter sanatoria that resembled prisons (the sanatoria for the middle and upper classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention).[172] Whatever the benefits of the \"fresh air\" and labor in the sanatoria, even under the best conditions, 50% of those who entered died within five years (c. 1916).[172] When the Medical Research Council formed in Britain in 1913, it initially focused on tuberculosis research.[181] In Europe, rates of tuberculosis began to rise in the early 1600s to a peak level in the 1800s, when it caused nearly 25% of all deaths.[182] In the 18th and 19th century, tuberculosis had become epidemic in Europe, showing a seasonal pattern.[183][184] By the 1950s mortality in Europe had decreased about 90%.[185] Improvements in sanitation, vaccination, and other public-health measures began significantly reducing rates of tuberculosis even before the arrival of streptomycin and other antibiotics, although the disease remained a significant threat.[185] In 1946, the development of the antibiotic streptomycin made effective treatment and cure of TB a reality. Prior to the introduction of this medication, the only treatment was surgical intervention, including the \"pneumothorax technique\", which involved collapsing an infected lung to \"rest\" it and to allow tuberculous lesions to heal.[186] Because of the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), surgery has been re-introduced for certain cases of TB infections. It involves the removal of infected chest cavities (\"bullae\") in the lungs to reduce the number of bacteria and to increase exposure of the remaining bacteria to antibiotics in the bloodstream.[187] Hopes of eliminating TB ended with the rise of drug-resistant strains in the 1980s. The subsequent resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1993.[188] Tuberculosis has been known by many names from the technical to the familiar.[189] Phthisis (Φθισις) is a Greek word for consumption, an old term for pulmonary tuberculosis;[8] around 460 BCE, Hippocrates described phthisis as a disease of dry seasons.[190] The abbreviation TB is short for tubercle bacillus. Consumption was the most common nineteenth century English word for the disease, and was also in use well into the twentieth century. The Latin root con meaning \\'completely\\' is linked to sumere meaning \\'to take up from under\\'.[191] In The Life and Death of Mr Badman by John Bunyan, the author calls consumption \"the captain of all these men of death.\"[192] \"Great white plague\" has also been used.[189] Tuberculosis was for centuries associated with poetic and artistic qualities among those infected, and was also known as \"the romantic disease\".[189][193] Major artistic figures such as the poets John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Edgar Allan Poe, the composer Frédéric Chopin,[194] the playwright Anton Chekhov, the novelists Franz Kafka, Katherine Mansfield,[195] Charlotte Brontë, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Thomas Mann, W. Somerset Maugham,[196] George Orwell,[197] and Robert Louis Stevenson, and the artists Alice Neel,[198] Jean-Antoine Watteau, Elizabeth Siddal, Marie Bashkirtseff, Edvard Munch, Aubrey Beardsley and Amedeo Modigliani either had the disease or were surrounded by people who did. A widespread belief was that tuberculosis assisted artistic talent. Physical mechanisms proposed for this effect included the slight fever and toxaemia that it caused, allegedly helping them to see life more clearly and to act decisively.[199][200][201] Tuberculosis formed an often-reused theme in literature, as in Thomas Mann\\'s The Magic Mountain, set in a sanatorium;[202] in music, as in Van Morrison\\'s song \"T.B. Sheets\";[203] in opera, as in Puccini\\'s La bohème and Verdi\\'s La Traviata;[201] in art, as in Monet\\'s painting of his first wife Camille on her deathbed;[204] and in film, such as the 1945 The Bells of St. Mary\\'s starring Ingrid Bergman as a nun with tuberculosis.[205] In 2014, the WHO adopted the \"End TB\" strategy which aims to reduce TB incidence by 80% and TB deaths by 90% by 2030.[206] The strategy contains a milestone to reduce TB incidence by 20% and TB deaths by 35% by 2020.[207] However, by 2020 only a 9% reduction in incidence per population was achieved globally, with the European region achieving 19% and the African region achieving 16% reductions.[207] Similarly, the number of deaths only fell by 14%, missing the 2020 milestone of a 35% reduction, with some regions making better progress (31% reduction in Europe and 19% in Africa).[207] Correspondingly, also treatment, prevention and funding milestones were missed in 2020, for example only 6.3 million people were started on TB prevention short of the target of 30 million.[207] The World Health Organization (WHO), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the U.S. government are subsidizing a fast-acting diagnostic tuberculosis test for use in low- and middle-income countries as of 2012.[208][209][210] In addition to being fast-acting, the test can determine if there is resistance to the antibiotic rifampicin which may indicate multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and is accurate in those who are also infected with HIV.[208][211] Many resource-poor places as of 2011[update] have access to only sputum microscopy.[212] India had the highest total number of TB cases worldwide in 2010, in part due to poor disease management within the private and public health care sector.[213] Programs such as the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program are working to reduce TB levels among people receiving public health care.[214][215] A 2014 EIU-healthcare report finds there is a need to address apathy and urges for increased funding. The report cites among others Lucica Ditui \"[TB] is like an orphan. It has been neglected even in countries with a high burden and often forgotten by donors and those investing in health interventions.\"[120] Slow progress has led to frustration, expressed by the executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria – Mark Dybul: \"we have the tools to end TB as a pandemic and public health threat on the planet, but we are not doing it.\"[120] Several international organizations are pushing for more transparency in treatment, and more countries are implementing mandatory reporting of cases to the government as of 2014, although adherence is often variable. Commercial treatment providers may at times overprescribe second-line drugs as well as supplementary treatment, promoting demands for further regulations.[120] The government of Brazil provides universal TB care, which reduces this problem.[120] Conversely, falling rates of TB infection may not relate to the number of programs directed at reducing infection rates but may be tied to an increased level of education, income, and health of the population.[120] Costs of the disease, as calculated by the World Bank in 2009 may exceed US$150\\xa0billion per year in \"high burden\" countries.[120] Lack of progress eradicating the disease may also be due to lack of patient follow-up – as among the 250 million rural migrants in China.[120] There is insufficient data to show that active contact tracing helps to improve case detection rates for tuberculosis.[216] Interventions such as house-to-house visits, educational leaflets, mass media strategies, educational sessions may increase tuberculosis detection rates in short-term.[217] There is no study that compares new methods of contact tracing such as social network analysis with existing contact tracing methods.[218] Slow progress in preventing the disease may in part be due to stigma associated with TB.[120] Stigma may be due to the fear of transmission from affected individuals. This stigma may additionally arise due to links between TB and poverty, and in Africa, AIDS.[120] Such stigmatization may be both real and perceived; for example, in Ghana, individuals with TB are banned from attending public gatherings.[219] Stigma towards TB may result in delays in seeking treatment,[120] lower treatment compliance, and family members keeping cause of death secret[219] – allowing the disease to spread further.[120] In contrast, in Russia stigma was associated with increased treatment compliance.[219] TB stigma also affects socially marginalized individuals to a greater degree and varies between regions.[219] One way to decrease stigma may be through the promotion of \"TB clubs\", where those infected may share experiences and offer support, or through counseling.[219] Some studies have shown TB education programs to be effective in decreasing stigma, and may thus be effective in increasing treatment adherence.[219] Despite this, studies on the relationship between reduced stigma and mortality are lacking as of 2010[update], and similar efforts to decrease stigma surrounding AIDS have been minimally effective.[219] Some have claimed the stigma to be worse than the disease, and healthcare providers may unintentionally reinforce stigma, as those with TB are often perceived as difficult or otherwise undesirable.[120] A greater understanding of the social and cultural dimensions of tuberculosis may also help with stigma reduction.[220] The BCG vaccine has limitations, and research to develop new TB vaccines is ongoing.[221] A number of potential candidates are currently in phase I and II clinical trials.[221][222] Two main approaches are used to attempt to improve the efficacy of available vaccines. One approach involves adding a subunit vaccine to BCG, while the other strategy is attempting to create new and better live vaccines.[221] MVA85A, an example of a subunit vaccine, is in trials in South Africa as of 2006, is based on a genetically modified vaccinia virus.[223] Vaccines are hoped to play a significant role in treatment of both latent and active disease.[224] To encourage further discovery, researchers and policymakers are promoting new economic models of vaccine development as of 2006, including prizes, tax incentives, and advance market commitments.[225][226] A number of groups, including the Stop TB Partnership,[227] the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, and the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation, are involved with research.[228] Among these, the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation received a gift of more than $280\\xa0million (US) from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop and license an improved vaccine against tuberculosis for use in high burden countries.[229][230] A number of medications are being studied as of 2012 for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, including bedaquiline and delamanid.[231] Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012.[232] The safety and effectiveness of these new agents are uncertain as of 2012, because they are based on the results of relatively small studies.[231][233] However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug,[234] which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians\\' support for its use.[233][235] Steroids add-on therapy has not shown any benefits for active pulmonary tuberculosis infection.[236] Mycobacteria infect many different animals, including birds,[237] fish, rodents,[238] and reptiles.[239] The subspecies Mycobacterium tuberculosis, though, is rarely present in wild animals.[240] An effort to eradicate bovine tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis from the cattle and deer herds of New Zealand has been relatively successful.[241] Efforts in Great Britain have been less successful.[242][243] As of 2015[update], tuberculosis appears to be widespread among captive elephants in the US. It is believed that the animals originally acquired the disease from humans, a process called reverse zoonosis. Because the disease can spread through the air to infect both humans and other animals, it is a public health concern affecting circuses and zoos.[244][245] Among untreated acute cases, 10% will shed bacteria for three months after initial onset of symptoms, and 2–5% will become chronic typhoid carriers.[1] Typhoid fever, also known as typhoid, is a disease caused by Salmonella serotype Typhi bacteria.[2] Symptoms vary from mild to severe, and usually begin six to 30 days after exposure.[3][4] Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days.[3] This is commonly accompanied by weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, and mild vomiting.[4][5] Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots.[4] In severe cases, people may experience confusion.[5] Without treatment, symptoms may last weeks or months.[4] Diarrhea may be severe, but is uncommon.[5] Other people may carry the bacterium without being affected, but they are still able to spread the disease.[6] Typhoid fever is a type of enteric fever, along with paratyphoid fever.[2] S. enterica Typhi is believed to infect and replicate only within humans.[7] Typhoid is caused by the bacterium Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi growing in the intestines, peyers patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, liver, gallbladder, bone marrow and blood.[4][5] Typhoid is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person.[6] Risk factors include limited access to clean drinking water and poor sanitation.[2] Those who have not yet been exposed to the pathogen and ingest contaminated drinking water or food are most at risk for developing symptoms.[5] Only humans can be infected; there are no known animal reservoirs.[6] Diagnosis is by culturing and identifying S. enterica Typhi from patient samples or detecting an immune response to the pathogen from blood samples.[4][2][8] Recently, new advances in large-scale data collection and analysis have allowed researchers to develop better diagnostics, such as detecting changing abundances of small molecules in the blood that may specifically indicate typhoid fever.[9] Diagnostic tools in regions where typhoid is most prevalent are quite limited in their accuracy and specificity, and the time required for a proper diagnosis, the increasing spread of antibiotic resistance, and the cost of testing are also hardships for under-resourced healthcare systems.[7] A typhoid vaccine can prevent about 40% to 90% of cases during the first two years.[10] The vaccine may have some effect for up to seven years.[2] For those at high risk or people traveling to areas where the disease is common, vaccination is recommended.[6] Other efforts to prevent the disease include providing clean drinking water, good sanitation, and handwashing.[4][6] Until an infection is confirmed as cleared, the infected person should not prepare food for others.[4] Typhoid is treated with antibiotics such as azithromycin, fluoroquinolones, or third-generation cephalosporins.[2] Resistance to these antibiotics has been developing, which has made treatment more difficult.[2][11][12] In 2015, 12.5 million new typhoid cases were reported.[13] The disease is most common in India.[2] Children are most commonly affected.[2][6] Typhoid decreased in the developed world in the 1940s as a result of improved sanitation and the use of antibiotics.[6] Every year about 400 cases are reported in the U.S. and an estimated 6,000 people have typhoid.[5][14] In 2015, it resulted in about 149,000 deaths worldwide – down from 181,000 in 1990.[15][16] Without treatment, the risk of death may be as high as 20%.[6] With treatment, it is between 1% and 4%.[2][6] Typhus is a different disease.[17] Owing to their similar symptoms, they were not recognized as distinct diseases until the 1800s. \"Typhoid\" means \"resembling typhus\".[18] Classically, the progression of untreated typhoid fever has three distinct stages, each lasting about a week. Over the course of these stages, the patient becomes exhausted and emaciated.[19] The Gram-negative bacterium that causes typhoid fever is Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi. Based on MLST subtyping scheme, the two main sequence types of the S. Typhi are ST1 and ST2, which are widespread globally.[22] Global phylogeographical analysis showed dominance of a haplotype 58 (H58), which probably originated in India during the late 1980s and is now spreading through the world with multi-drug resistance.[23] A more detailed genotyping scheme was reported in 2016 and is now being used widely. This scheme reclassified the nomenclature of H58 to genotype 4.3.1.[24] Unlike other strains of Salmonella, no animal carriers of typhoid are known.[25] Humans are the only known carriers of the bacterium.[25] S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi is spread by the fecal-oral route from people who are infected and from asymptomatic carriers of the bacterium.[25] An asymptomatic human carrier is someone who is still excreting typhoid bacteria in stool a year after the acute stage of the infection.[25] Diagnosis is made by any blood, bone marrow, or stool cultures and with the Widal test (demonstration of antibodies against Salmonella antigens O-somatic and H-flagellar). In epidemics and less wealthy countries, after excluding malaria, dysentery, or pneumonia, a therapeutic trial time with chloramphenicol is generally undertaken while awaiting the results of the Widal test and blood and stool cultures.[26] The Widal test is used to identify specific antibodies in the serum of people with typhoid by using antigen-antibody interactions.[citation needed] In this test, the serum is mixed with a dead bacterial suspension of salmonella with specific antigens. If the patient\\'s serum contains antibodies against those antigens, they get attached to them, forming clumps. If clumping does not occur, the test is negative. The Widal test is time-consuming and prone to significant false positives. It may also be falsely negative in recently infected people. But unlike the Typhidot test, the Widal test quantifies the specimen with titres.[27] Rapid diagnostic tests such as Tubex, Typhidot, and Test-It have shown moderate diagnostic accuracy.[28] Typhidot is based on the presence of specific IgM and IgG antibodies to a specific 50Kd OMP antigen. This test is carried out on a cellulose nitrate membrane where a specific S. typhi outer membrane protein is attached as fixed test lines. It separately identifies IgM and IgG antibodies. IgM shows recent infection; IgG signifies remote infection.[citation needed] The sample pad of this kit contains colloidal gold-anti-human IgG or gold-anti-human IgM. If the sample contains IgG and IgM antibodies against those antigens, they will react and turn red. The typhidot test becomes positive within 2–3 days of infection.[citation needed] Two colored bands indicate a positive test. A single control band indicates a negative test. A single first fixed line or no band at all indicates an invalid test. Typhidot\\'s biggest limitation is that it is not quantitative, just positive or negative.[29] The Tubex test contains two types of particles: brown magnetic particles coated with antigen and blue indicator particles coated with O9 antibody. During the test, if antibodies are present in the serum, they will attach to the brown magnetic particles and settle at the base, while the blue indicator particles remain in the solution, producing a blue color, which means the test is positive.[citation needed] If the serum does not have an antibody in it, the blue particles attach to the brown particles and settle at the bottom, producing a colorless solution, which means the test is negative.[30] Sanitation and hygiene are important to prevent typhoid. It can spread only in environments where human feces can come into contact with food or drinking water. Careful food preparation and washing of hands are crucial to prevent typhoid. Industrialization contributed greatly to the elimination of typhoid fever, as it eliminated the public-health hazards associated with having horse manure in public streets, which led to a large number of flies,[31] which are vectors of many pathogens, including Salmonella spp.[32] According to statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the chlorination of drinking water has led to dramatic decreases in the transmission of typhoid fever.[33] Two typhoid vaccines are licensed for use for the prevention of typhoid:[10] the live, oral Ty21a vaccine (sold as Vivotif by Crucell Switzerland AG) and the injectable typhoid polysaccharide vaccine (sold as Typhim Vi by Sanofi Pasteur and Typherix by GlaxoSmithKline). Both are efficacious and recommended for travelers to areas where typhoid is endemic. Boosters are recommended every five years for the oral vaccine and every two years for the injectable form.[10] An older, killed whole-cell vaccine is still used in countries where the newer preparations are not available, but this vaccine is no longer recommended for use because it has more side effects (mainly pain and inflammation at the site of the injection).[34] To help decrease rates of typhoid fever in developing nations, the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed the use of a vaccination program starting in 1999. Vaccination has proven effective at controlling outbreaks in high-incidence areas and is also very cost-effective: prices are normally less than US$1 per dose. Because the price is low, poverty-stricken communities are more willing to take advantage of the vaccinations.[35] Although vaccination programs for typhoid have proven effective, they alone cannot eliminate typhoid fever.[35] Combining vaccines with public-health efforts is the only proven way to control this disease.[35] Since the 1990s, the WHO has recommended two typhoid fever vaccines. The ViPS vaccine is given by injection, and the Ty21a by capsules. Only people over age two are recommended to be vaccinated with the ViPS vaccine, and it requires a revaccination after 2–3 years, with a 55%–72% efficacy. The Ty21a vaccine is recommended for people five and older, lasting 5–7 years with 51%–67% efficacy. The two vaccines have proved safe and effective for epidemic disease control in multiple regions.[35] A version of the vaccine combined with a hepatitis A vaccine is also available.[36] Results of a phase 3 trial of typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) in December 2019 reported 81% fewer cases among children.[37][38] The rediscovery of oral rehydration therapy in the 1960s provided a simple way to prevent many of the deaths of diarrheal diseases in general.[39] Where resistance is uncommon, the treatment of choice is a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin.[40][41] Otherwise, a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime is the first choice.[42][43][44][45] Cefixime is a suitable oral alternative.[46][47] Properly treated, typhoid fever is not fatal in most cases. Antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin have been commonly used to treat it.[48] Treatment with antibiotics reduces the case-fatality rate to about 1%.[49] Without treatment, some patients develop sustained fever, bradycardia, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal symptoms, and occasionally pneumonia. In white-skinned patients, pink spots, which fade on pressure, appear on the skin of the trunk in up to 20% of cases. In the third week, untreated cases may develop gastrointestinal and cerebral complications, which may prove fatal in 10%–20% of cases. The highest case fatality rates are reported in children under 4. Around 2%–5% of those who contract typhoid fever become chronic carriers, as bacteria persist in the biliary tract after symptoms have resolved.[50] Surgery is usually indicated if intestinal perforation occurs. One study found a 30-day mortality rate of 9% (8/88), and surgical site infections at 67% (59/88), with the disease burden borne predominantly by low-resource countries.[51] For surgical treatment, most surgeons prefer simple closure of the perforation with drainage of the peritoneum. Small-bowel resection is indicated for patients with multiple perforations. If antibiotic treatment fails to eradicate the hepatobiliary carriage, the gallbladder should be resected. Cholecystectomy is sometimes successful, especially in patients with gallstones, but is not always successful in eradicating the carrier state because of persisting hepatic infection.[52][53] As resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and streptomycin is now common, these agents are no longer used as first–line treatment of typhoid fever.[54] Typhoid resistant to these agents is known as multidrug-resistant typhoid.[55] Ciprofloxacin resistance is an increasing problem, especially in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Many centres are shifting from ciprofloxacin to ceftriaxone as the first line for treating suspected typhoid originating in South America, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Thailand, or Vietnam. Also, it has been suggested that azithromycin is better at treating resistant typhoid than both fluoroquinolone drugs and ceftriaxone.[41] Azithromycin can be taken by mouth and is less expensive than ceftriaxone, which is given by injection.[56] A separate problem exists with laboratory testing for reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin; current recommendations are that isolates should be tested simultaneously against ciprofloxacin (CIP) and against nalidixic acid (NAL), that isolates sensitive to both CIP and NAL should be reported as \"sensitive to ciprofloxacin\", and that isolates sensitive to CIP but not to NAL should be reported as \"reduced sensitivity to ciprofloxacin\". But an analysis of 271 isolates found that around 18% of isolates with a reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, the class which CIP belongs (MIC 0.125–1.0\\xa0mg/L), would not be detected by this method.[57] In 2000, typhoid fever caused an estimated 21.7 million illnesses and 217,000 deaths.[8] It occurs most often in children and young adults between 5 and 19 years old.[58] In 2013, it resulted in about 161,000 deaths – down from 181,000 in 1990.[16] Infants, children, and adolescents in south-central and Southeast Asia have the highest rates of typhoid.[59] Outbreaks are also often reported in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.[60][61][62] In 2000, more than 90% of morbidity and mortality due to typhoid fever occurred in Asia.[63] In the U.S., about 400 cases occur each year, 75% of which are acquired while traveling internationally.[64][65] Before the antibiotic era, the case fatality rate of typhoid fever was 10%–20%. Today, with prompt treatment, it is less than 1%,[66] but 3%–5% of people who are infected develop a chronic infection in the gall bladder.[67] Since S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi is human-restricted, these chronic carriers become the crucial reservoir, which can persist for decades for further spread of the disease, further complicating its identification and treatment.[53] Lately, the study of S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi associated with a large outbreak and a carrier at the genome level provides new insight into the pathogenesis of the pathogen.[68][69] In industrialized nations, water sanitation and food handling improvements have reduced the number of typhoid cases.[70] Developing nations have the highest rates. These areas lack access to clean water, proper sanitation systems, and proper health-care facilities. In these areas, such access to basic public-health needs is not expected in the near future.[71] In 2004–2005 an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo resulted in more than 42,000 cases and 214 deaths.[58] Since November 2016, Pakistan has had an outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid fever.[72] In Europe, a report based on data for 2017 retrieved from The European Surveillance System (TESSy) on the distribution of confirmed typhoid and paratyphoid fever cases found that 22 EU/EEA countries reported a total of 1,098 cases, 90.9% of which were travel-related, mainly acquired during travel to South Asia.[73] The plague of Athens, during the Peloponnesian War, was most likely an outbreak of typhoid fever.[77] During the war, Athenians retreated into a walled-in city to escape attack from the Spartans. This massive influx of humans into a concentrated space overwhelmed the water supply and waste infrastructure, likely leading to unsanitary conditions as fresh water became harder to obtain and waste became more difficult to collect and remove beyond the city walls.[77] In 2006, examining the remains for a mass burial site from Athens from around the time of the plague (~430 B.C.) revealed that fragments of DNA similar to modern day S. Typhi DNA were detected, whereas Yersinia pestis (plague), Rickettsia prowazekii (typhus), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, cowpox virus, and Bartonella henselae were not detected in any of the remains tested.[75] It is possible that the Roman emperor Augustus Caesar had either a liver abscess or typhoid fever, and survived by using ice baths and cold compresses as a means of treatment for his fever.[77] There is a statue of the Greek physician, Antonius Musa, who treated his fever.[citation needed] The French doctors Pierre-Fidele Bretonneau and Pierre-Charles-Alexandre Louis are credited with describing typhoid fever as a specific disease, unique from typhus. Both doctors performed autopsies on individuals who died in Paris due to fever – and indicated that many had lesions on the Peyer\\'s patches which correlated with distinct symptoms before death.[77] British medics were skeptical of the differentiation between typhoid and typhus because both were endemic to Britain at that time. However, in France only typhoid was present circulating in the population.[77] Pierre-Charlles-Alexandre Louis also performed case studies and statistical analysis to demonstrate that typhoid was contagious - and that persons who already had the disease seemed to be protected.[77] Afterward, several American doctors confirmed these findings, and then Sir William Jenner convinced any remaining skeptics that typhoid is a specific disease recognizable by lesions in the Peyer\\'s patches by examining sixty-six autopsies from fever patients and concluding that the symptoms of headaches, diarrhea, rash spots, and abdominal pain were present only in patients who were found to have intestinal lesions after death; these observations solidified the association of the disease with the intestinal tract and gave the first clue to the route of transmission.[77] In 1847 William Budd learned of an epidemic of typhoid fever in Clifton, and identified that all 13 of 34 residents who had contracted the disease drew their drinking water from the same well.[77] Notably, this observation was two years prior to John Snow discovering the route of contaminated water as the cause for a cholera outbreak. Budd later became health officer of Bristol and ensured a clean water supply, and documented further evidence of typhoid as a water-borne illness throughout his career.[77] Polish scientist Tadeusz Browicz described a short bacillus in the organs and feces of typhoid victims in 1874.[85] Browicz was able to isolate and grow the bacilli but did not go as far as to insinuate or prove that they caused the disease.[77] In April 1880, three months prior to Eberth\\'s publication, Edwin Klebs described short and filamentous bacilli in the Peyer\\'s patches in typhoid victims.[86] The bacterium\\'s role in disease was speculated but not confirmed.[77] In 1880, Karl Joseph Eberth described a bacillus that he suspected was the cause of typhoid.[87][88][89]  Eberth is given credit for discovering the bacterium definitively by successfully isolating the same bacterium from 18 of 40 typhoid victims and failing to discover the bacterium present in any \"control\" victims of other diseases.[77] In 1884, pathologist Georg Theodor August Gaffky (1850–1918) confirmed Eberth\\'s findings.[90] Gaffky isolated the same bacterium as Eberth from the spleen of a typhoid victim, and was able to grow the bacterium on solid media.[77] The organism was given names such as Eberth\\'s bacillus, Eberthella Typhi, and Gaffky-Eberth bacillus.[77] Today, the bacillus that causes typhoid fever goes by the scientific name Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi.[91] Most developed countries had declining rates of typhoid fever throughout the first half of the 20th century due to vaccinations and advances in public sanitation and hygiene. In 1893 attempts were made to chlorinate the water supply in Hamburg, Germany and in 1897 Maidstone, England, was the first town to have its entire water supply chlorinated.[92]  In 1905, following an outbreak of typhoid fever, the City of Lincoln, England, instituted permanent water chlorination.[93]  The first permanent disinfection of drinking water in the US was made in 1908 to the Jersey City, New Jersey, water supply. Credit for the decision to build the chlorination system has been given to John L. Leal.[94] The chlorination facility was designed by George W. Fuller.[95] Outbreaks in traveling military groups led to the creation of the Lyster bag in 1915; a bag with a faucet which can be hung from a tree or pole, filled with water, and comes with a chlorination tablet to drop into the water.[77] The Lyster bag was essential for the survival of American soldiers in the Vietnam War.[77] There were several occurrences of milk delivery men spreading typhoid fever throughout the communities they served. Although typhoid is not spread through milk itself, there were several examples of milk distributors in many locations watering their milk down with contaminated water, or cleaning the glass bottles the milk was placed in with contaminated water.[77][80] Boston had two such cases around the turn of the 20th century.[80] In 1899 there were 24 cases of typhoid traced to a single milkman, whose wife had died of typhoid fever a week before the outbreak.[80] In 1908, J.J. Fallon, who was also a milkman, died of typhoid fever.[80]  Following his death and confirmation of the typhoid fever diagnosis, the city conducted an investigation of typhoid symptoms and cases along his route and found evidence of a significant outbreak. A month after the outbreak was first reported, the Boston Globe published a short statement declaring the outbreak over, stating \"[a]t Jamaica Plain there is a slight increase, the total being 272 cases. Throughout the city there is a total of 348 cases.\"[80] There was at least one death reported during this outbreak: Mrs. Sophia S. Engstrom, aged 46.[80] Typhoid continued to ravage the Jamaica Plain neighborhood in particular throughout 1908, and several more people were reported dead due to typhoid fever, although these cases were not explicitly linked to the outbreak.[80] The Jamaica Plain neighborhood at that time was home to many working-class and poor immigrants, mostly from Ireland.[96] The most notorious carrier of typhoid fever, but by no means the most destructive, was Mary Mallon, known as Typhoid Mary.[97][82] Although other cases of human-to-human spread of typhoid were known at the time, the concept of an asymptomatic carrier, who was able to transmit disease, had only been hypothesized and not yet identified or proven.[77] Mary Mallon became the first known example of an asymptomatic carrier of an infectious disease, making typhoid fever the first known disease being transmissible through asymptomatic hosts.[77] The cases and deaths caused by Mallon were mainly upper-class families in New York City.[77] At the time of Mallon\\'s tenure as a personal cook for upper-class families, New York City reported 3,000 to 4,500 cases of typhoid fever annually.[77] In the summer of 1906 two daughters of a wealthy family and maids working in their home became ill with typhoid fever.[77] After investigating their home water sources and ruling out water contamination, the family hired civil engineer George Soper to conduct an investigation of the possible source of typhoid fever in the home.[77] Soper described himself as an \"epidemic fighter\".[77] His investigation ruled out many sources of food, and led him to question if the cook the family hired just prior to their household outbreak, Mallon, was the source.[77] Since she had already left and begun employment elsewhere, he proceeded to track her down in order to obtain a stool sample.[77]  When he was able to finally meet Mallon in person he described her by saying \"Mary had a good figure and might have been called athletic had she not been a little too heavy.\"[81] In recounts of Soper\\'s pursuit of Mallon, his only remorse appears to be that he was not given enough credit for his relentless pursuit and publication of her personal identifying information, stating that the media \"rob[s] me of whatever credit belongs to the discovery of the first typhoid fever carrier to be found in America.\"[81] Ultimately, 51 cases and 3 deaths were suspected to be caused by Mallon.[98][82] In 1924 the city of Portland, Oregon, experienced an outbreak of typhoid fever, consisting of 26 cases and 5 deaths, all deaths due to intestinal hemorrhage.[99] All cases were concluded to be due to a single milk farm worker, who was shedding large amounts of the typhoid pathogen in his urine.[99] Misidentification of the disease, due to inaccurate Widal test results, delayed identification of the carrier and proper treatment.[99] Ultimately, it took four samplings of different secretions from all of the dairy workers in order to successfully identify the carrier.[99] Upon discovery, the dairy worker was forcibly quarantined for seven weeks, and regular samples were taken, most of the time the stool samples yielding no typhoid and often the urine yielding the pathogen.[99] The carrier was reported as being 72 years old and appearing in excellent health with no symptoms.[99] Pharmaceutical treatment decreased the amount of bacteria secreted, however, the infection was never fully cleared from the urine, and the carrier was released \"under orders never again to engage in the handling of foods for human consumption.\"[99] At the time of release, the authors noted \"for more than fifty years he has earned his living chiefly by milking cows and knows little of other forms of labor, it must be expected that the closest surveillance will be necessary to make certain that he does not again engage in this occupation.\"[99] Overall, in the early 20th century the medical profession began to identify carriers of the disease, and evidence of transmission independent of water contamination.[77] In a 1933 American Medical Association publication, physicians\\' treatment of asymptomatic carriers is best summarized by the opening line \"Carriers of typhoid bacilli are a menace\".[100] Within the same publication, the first official estimate of typhoid carriers is given: 2 to 5% of all typhoid patients, and distinguished between temporary carriers and chronic carriers.[100] The authors further estimate that there are four to five chronic female carriers to every one male carrier, although offered no data to explain this assertion of a gender difference in the rate of typhoid carriers.[100] As far as treatment, the authors suggest: \"When recognized, carriers must be instructed as to the disposal of excreta as well as to the importance of personal cleanliness. They should be forbidden to handle food or drink intended for others, and their movements and whereabouts must be reported to the public health officers\".[100] Today, typhoid carriers exist all over the world, but the highest incidence of asymptomatic infection is likely to occur in South/Southeast Asian and Sub-Saharan countries.[1][101] The Los Angeles County department of public health tracks typhoid carriers and reports the number of carriers identified within the county yearly; between 2006 and 2016 0-4 new cases of typhoid carriers were identified per year.[1] Cases of typhoid fever must be reported within one working day from identification. As of 2018, chronic typhoid carriers must sign a \"Carrier Agreement\" and are required to test for typhoid shedding twice yearly, ideally every 6 months.[102] Carriers may be released from their agreements upon fulfilling \"release\" requirements, based on completion of a personalized treatment plan designed with medical professionals.[102] Fecal or gallbladder carrier release requirements: 6 consecutive negative feces and urine specimens submitted at 1-month or greater intervals beginning at least 7 days after completion of therapy.[102] Urinary or kidney carrier release requirements: 6 consecutive negative urine specimens submitted at 1-month or greater intervals beginning at least 7 days after completion of therapy.[102] As of 2016 the male:female ratio of carriers in Los Angeles county was 3:1.[1] Due to the nature of asymptomatic cases, many questions remain about how individuals are able to tolerate infection for long periods of time, how to identify such cases, and efficient options for treatment. Researchers are currently working to understand asymptomatic infection with Salmonella species by studying infections in laboratory animals, which will ultimately lead to improved prevention and treatment options for typhoid carriers. In 2002, John Gunn described the ability of Salmonella sp. to form biofilms on gallstones in mice, providing a model for studying carriage in the gallbladder.[103] Denise Monack and Stanley Falkow described a mouse model of asymptomatic intestinal and systemic infection in 2004, and Monack went on to demonstrate that a sub-population of superspreaders are responsible for the majority of transmission to new hosts, following the 80/20 rule of disease transmission, and that the intestinal microbiota likely plays a role in transmission.[104][105] Monack\\'s mouse model allows long-term carriage of salmonella in mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and liver.[104] British bacteriologist Almroth Edward Wright first developed an effective typhoid vaccine at the Army Medical School in Netley, Hampshire. It was introduced in 1896 and used successfully by the British during the Second Boer War in South Africa.[106] At that time, typhoid often killed more soldiers at war than were lost due to enemy combat. Wright further developed his vaccine at a newly opened research department at St Mary\\'s Hospital Medical School in London from 1902, where he established a method for measuring protective substances (opsonin) in human blood.[107] Wright\\'s version of the typhoid vaccine was produced by growing the bacterium at body temperature in broth, then heating the bacteria to 60\\xa0°C to \"heat inactivate\" the pathogen, killing it, while keeping the surface antigens intact. The heat-killed bacteria was then injected into a patient.[77] To show evidence of the vaccine\\'s efficacy, Wright then collected serum samples from patients several weeks post-vaccination, and tested their serum\\'s ability to agglutinate live typhoid bacteria. A \"positive\" result was represented by clumping of bacteria, indicating that the body was producing anti-serum (now called antibodies) against the pathogen.[77] Citing the example of the Second Boer War, during which many soldiers died from easily preventable diseases, Wright convinced the British Army that 10 million vaccine doses should be produced for the troops being sent to the Western Front, thereby saving up to half a million lives during World War I.[108] The British Army was the only combatant at the outbreak of the war to have its troops fully immunized against the bacterium. For the first time, their casualties due to combat exceeded those from disease.[109] In 1909, Frederick F. Russell, a U.S. Army physician, adopted Wright\\'s typhoid vaccine for use with the Army, and two years later, his vaccination program became the first in which an entire army was immunized. It eliminated typhoid as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. military.[110] Typhoid vaccination for members of the American military became mandatory in 1911.[77] Before the vaccine, the rate of typhoid fever in the military was 14,000 or greater per 100,000 soldiers. By World War I, the rate of typhoid in American soldiers was 37 per 100,000.[77] During the second world war, the United States army authorized the use of a trivalent vaccine – containing heat-inactivated Typhoid, Paratyphi A and Paratyphi B pathogens.[77] In 1934, discovery of the Vi capsular antigen by Arthur Felix and Miss S. R. Margaret Pitt enabled development of the safer Vi Antigen vaccine – which is widely in use today.[111] Arthur Felix and Margaret Pitt also isolated the strain Ty2, which became the parent strain of Ty21a, the strain used as a live-attenuated vaccine for typhoid fever today.[112] Chloramphenicol was isolated from Streptomyces by David Gotlieb during the 1940s.[77] In 1948 American army doctors tested its efficacy in treating typhoid patients in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.[77] Individuals who received a full course of treatment cleared the infection, whereas patients given a lower dose had a relapse.[77] Asymptomatic carriers continued to shed bacilli despite chloramphenicol treatment - only ill patients were improved with chloramphenicol.[77] Resistance to chloramphenicol became frequent in Southeast Asia by the 1950s, and today chloramphenicol is only used as a last resort due to the high prevalence of resistance.[77] The disease has been referred to by various names, often associated with symptoms, such as gastric fever, enteric fever, abdominal typhus, infantile remittant fever, slow fever, nervous fever, pythogenic fever,[113] drain fever and low fever.[114] #version: 0.2 Ġ t Ġ a i n Ä ł r e h e Ġ o o n e r t i e n e s Ġ in Ġt he i s Ġ s a l e d Ġ c Ġ m i t a t a r Ġa n Ġ p Ġ d a n a s i c Ġ b Ġo f Ġ w r o Ġ f .
